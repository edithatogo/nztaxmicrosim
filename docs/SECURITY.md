# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our project seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability within this project, please report it to us as soon as possible.

**Please do NOT open a public issue.**

Instead, please send an email to security@nztaxmicrosim.org with the following information:

*   A clear and concise description of the vulnerability.
*   Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
*   The potential impact of the vulnerability.
*   Any suggested mitigations or fixes (if you have them).

We will acknowledge your email within 48 hours and will work with you to understand and address the issue. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose security vulnerabilities.

## Disclosure Policy

Once a security vulnerability is reported, we will:

1.  Confirm the vulnerability and determine its impact.
2.  Develop a fix or mitigation strategy.
3.  Release a new version of the software with the fix.
4.  Publicly disclose the vulnerability and the steps taken to address it, giving credit to the reporter (unless they prefer to remain anonymous).

We aim to resolve all security issues in a timely manner.
