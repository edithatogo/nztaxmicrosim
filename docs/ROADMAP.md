# Roadmap

This document outlines development priorities for the NZ Microsimulation Model, which aims to assess New Zealand tax settings through static and dynamic analysis of budget impact, personal income outcomes, equity, and value-of-information.

## Upcoming Tasks

1. **Core Static Personal Income Model**
   - *Milestone:* Finalize baseline calculations for individual liabilities and incomes.
   - *Priority:* **High**

2. **Modular Simulation Pipeline**
   - *Milestone:* Design plug-in architecture for tax and benefit rules.
   - *Priority:* **High**

3. **Dynamic Behavioural Extensions**
   - *Milestone:* Introduce modules that capture behavioural responses and longitudinal impacts of policy changes.
   - *Priority:* **Medium**

4. **Complete Sensitivity Analysis Tools**
   - *Milestone:* Finalize parameter sweep utilities and integrate with scenario management.
   - *Priority:* **Medium**

5. **Budget Impact Modules**
   - *Milestone:* Build routines to aggregate fiscal costs and savings across scenarios.
   - *Priority:* **High**

6. **Expanded Equity Metrics**
   - *Milestone:* Introduce additional indicators of distributional effects (e.g., progressivity indexes).
   - *Priority:* **Medium**

7. **Value-of-Information Analysis**
   - *Milestone:* Add module for assessing the benefit of additional data sources or improved data quality.
   - *Priority:* **Medium**

## Short-Term Milestones

- **Q3 2025:** Deliver the completed static personal income model and begin work on dynamic behavioural extensions.
- **Q4 2025:** Release budget impact functionality alongside the first round of new equity metrics and value-of-information analysis.
