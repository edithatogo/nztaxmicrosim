# Roadmap

This document outlines upcoming development priorities for the NZ Microsimulation Model.

## Upcoming Tasks

1. **Complete Sensitivity Analysis Tools**
   - *Milestone:* Finalize parameter sweep utilities and integrate with scenario management.
   - *Priority:* **High**

2. **Implement Value-of-Information Analysis**
   - *Milestone:* Add module for assessing the benefit of additional data sources or improved data quality.
   - *Priority:* **Medium**

3. **Budget Impact Modules**
   - *Milestone:* Build routines to aggregate fiscal costs and savings across scenarios.
   - *Priority:* **High**

4. **Expanded Equity Metrics**
   - *Milestone:* Introduce additional indicators of distributional effects (e.g., progressivity indexes).
   - *Priority:* **Medium**

5. **Modular Simulation Pipeline**
   - *Milestone:* Allow tax and benefit rules to be assembled via plug-in modules with configurable order and substitution.
   - *Priority:* **Medium**

## Short-Term Milestones

- **Q3 2025:** Deliver the completed sensitivity tools and begin work on value-of-information analysis.
- **Q4 2025:** Release budget impact functionality alongside the first round of new equity metrics.
