This repository aims to produce a microsimulator for New Zealand tax settings capable of both static and dynamic analysis to evaluate budget impact, personal income outcomes, equity, value-of-information, and related metrics.

- Before committing, run `ruff check .` and `ruff format --check .` to ensure code style.
- Ensure all tests pass by running `pytest`.
- Update documentation (`README.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `TODO.md`) when features change.
- Use clear, descriptive commit messages.
