Introduction","text":"<p>Microsimulation models are an essential tool for policymakers and researchers, providing a detailed picture of the distributional impacts of tax and transfer policies. In New Zealand, Inland Revenue maintains a suite of SAS-based microsimulation models that are used to inform policy decisions. While these models are highly sophisticated, their use of proprietary software and their reliance on confidential microdata limit their accessibility to a wider audience.</p> <p>This paper introduces a new, open-source microsimulation model of the New Zealand tax and transfer system, implemented in Python. The model, which we call \"NZ-Microsim,\" is a translation of the existing SAS-based models used by Inland Revenue. The primary goal of the project is to create a transparent, accessible, and extensible tool that can be used by researchers, policymakers, and the public to better understand the New Zealand tax and transfer system.</p> <p>The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 discusses the motivation for the project in more detail. Section 3 describes the methodology used to translate the SAS code to Python. Section 4 presents the initial results of the model, including a comparison with the outputs of the original SAS models. Section 5 discusses the potential for future development, and Section 6 concludes.</p>"},{"location":"nz_microsim_paper/#2-motivation","title":"2. Motivation","text":"<p>The development of NZ-Microsim is motivated by three main factors:</p> <ul> <li>Transparency: The use of open-source software (Python) and the public availability of the model's source code will increase the transparency of the modeling process. This will allow researchers and other interested parties to scrutinize the assumptions and methodology used in the model, leading to greater confidence in its results.</li> <li>Accessibility: By removing the need for a SAS license, NZ-Microsim will be accessible to a wider range of users, including academics, students, and journalists. This will facilitate a more informed public debate about tax and transfer policy in New Zealand.</li> <li>Extensibility: The modular design of NZ-Microsim will make it easy to extend the model to incorporate new policies or to explore the impacts of different behavioral assumptions.

Methodology","text":"<p>The translation of the SAS code to Python was undertaken in a systematic and rigorous manner. The process involved the following steps:</p> <ol> <li>Code Extraction: The SAS code was extracted from the PDF documents provided by Inland Revenue.</li> <li>Code Analysis: The SAS code was analyzed to understand the logic of the models and to identify the key data structures and algorithms.</li> <li>Python Implementation: The SAS code was translated to Python, with a focus on creating a clear, concise, and well-documented implementation.</li> <li>Testing and Validation: A comprehensive suite of unit tests was developed to ensure that the Python code accurately replicates the functionality of the original SAS models.</li> </ol> <p>A key challenge in the translation process was the handling of microdata. The original SAS models use confidential microdata from Inland Revenue's administrative records. To ensure that NZ-Microsim is self-contained and does not require access to sensitive data, we have used appropriate parameters and distributions to simulate the underlying microdata. This approach allows us to replicate the key features of the microdata while preserving the privacy of individuals.</p>"},{"location":"nz_microsim_paper/#4-initial-results","title":"4.

This requires defining:</p> <ul> <li> <p>An Objective Function: This is what we want to maximise or minimise. It could be a single objective or a combination of multiple objectives. Examples include:</p> <ul> <li>Maximising total tax revenue for the government.</li> <li>Minimising income inequality (e.g., as measured by the Gini coefficient).</li> <li>Maximising the average disposable income of households in the bottom quintile.</li> <li>A weighted combination of the above.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Decision Variables: These are the policy parameters that the optimisation module can change. Examples include:</p> <ul> <li>Income tax bracket thresholds.</li> <li>Income tax rates for each bracket.</li> <li>The amount of a specific tax credit (e.g., the Independent Earner Tax Credit).</li> <li>The abatement rate for a benefit.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Constraints: These are the rules that must be followed. Examples include:</p> <ul> <li>The total cost to the government cannot exceed a certain amount.</li> <li>Tax rates cannot be negative or exceed 100%.</li> <li>The order of tax brackets must be maintained.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>The optimisation problem is then to find the set of decision variables that maximises (or minimises) the objective function, subject to the constraints.</p>"},{"location":"optimisation_module_proposal/#2-proposed-approach","title":"2. Proposed Approach","text":"<p>We can think of this as a \"black box\" optimisation problem. The microsimulation model is the black box: we give it a set of policy parameters, and it gives us a set of outcomes (like total tax revenue and a Gini coefficient). We want to find the best set of inputs to this black box.</p> <p>Given the complexity of the microsimulation model, the relationship between the policy parameters and the outcomes is likely to be non-linear, with many local optima. This means that traditional gradient-based optimisation methods may not be suitable.</p> <p>A more promising approach is to use metaheuristic optimisation algorithms, such as:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Genetic Algorithms (GAs): These algorithms are inspired by the process of natural selection. They work with a \"population\" of candidate solutions (sets of policy parameters). In each generation, the best solutions are selected and \"bred\" to create a new generation of solutions. This process is repeated until a good solution is found. GAs are well-suited to this kind of problem because they can explore a large and complex search space without getting stuck in local optima.</p> </li> <li> <p>Simulated Annealing (SA): This algorithm is inspired by the process of annealing in metallurgy. It starts with a random solution and then iteratively tries to improve it by making small random changes. It is more likely to accept changes that lead to a better solution, but it will sometimes accept changes that lead to a worse solution. This allows it to escape local optima.</p> </li> <li> <p>Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO): This algorithm is inspired by the social behaviour of birds flocking or fish schooling. It works with a \"swarm\" of particles, where each particle represents a candidate solution. The particles move through the search space, and their movement is influenced by their own best-known position and the best-known position of the entire swarm.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"optimisation_module_proposal/#high-level-architecture","title":"High-Level Architecture","text":"<p>The optimisation module would work as follows:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Initialisation: The user defines the objective function, the decision variables, and the constraints.

The objective function is then evaluated for each candidate solution.</p> </li> <li> <p>Selection and Variation: The optimisation algorithm selects the best candidate solutions and uses them to generate a new set of candidate solutions.</p> </li> <li> <p>Termination: Steps 2 and 3 are repeated until a termination condition is met (e.g., a certain number of generations have been run, or the solution has not improved for a certain number of generations).</p> </li> <li> <p>Output: The best solution found is returned to the user.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"optimisation_module_proposal/#3-integration-with-the-microsimulation-model","title":"3.

It may be necessary to use a simplified version of the model for the optimisation, or to use parallel computing to speed up the process.</p> </li> <li> <p>Defining \"Equity\": There are many different ways to measure equity (e.g., the Gini coefficient, the Palma ratio, the Theil index). The choice of equity measure will affect the results of the optimisation. It is important to choose a measure that is appropriate for the research question.</p> </li> <li> <p>Dynamic Microsimulation: The current model has a placeholder for dynamic simulation. If the model were to become fully dynamic (i.e., if it were to model the behavioural responses of individuals to policy changes), the optimisation problem would become much more complex.

Modern, very easy to use, powerful algorithms (TPE, CMA-ES), great visualization tools, and a large community. Getting started quickly with a flexible and powerful tool that can handle a wide variety of optimization problems. 2. Scikit-optimize Specializes in Bayesian Optimization, which is highly efficient when each function call (i.e., each simulation run) is very slow and computationally expensive. Problems where the simulation takes a long time to run, as it's designed to find a good solution in the fewest possible iterations. 3. SciPy (optimize) Robust and Standard.

since its inception in 1891, moving from minimal flat-rate taxes to a modern progressive structure with multiple brackets, credits, and levies. This document provides a comprehensive historical record of New Zealand\u2019s personal income tax rules and thresholds, from the present day back to the earliest available records. The objective is to support the auditing and enhancement of a tax microsimulation model by cataloguing tax rates, bracket thresholds, tax credits, and mandatory levies across time. We emphasize personal income tax for individuals (both residents and non-residents), including tax bracket rates and thresholds, personal tax credits (such as the Independent Earner Tax Credit and Working for Families credits), and levies or mandatory deductions affecting take-home pay (notably the ACC earner\u2019s levy and historical analogues). We also identify major structural reforms \u2013 for example, the introduction or removal of tax brackets, the creation of new tax credits, or significant shifts in tax policy \u2013 to contextualize how the system has changed over time.</p> <p>By consolidating information from official government sources (Inland Revenue, The Treasury, New Zealand Parliamentary records, etc.) and reputable historical analyses, this document aims to serve as a reliable reference. Researchers and policymakers can trace how tax parameters have changed annually (where data allows), facilitating verification of microsimulation inputs and enabling adaptation of the model to different historical or policy scenarios. Key changes are illustrated with tables and timelines, and we include visual aids (Mermaid diagrams and charts) to depict structural changes in tax rates and thresholds. An appendix provides example code for visualizing threshold changes over time, demonstrating how the data compiled here can be used in practice. All information is thoroughly cited with sources (in APA style with hyperlinks) to enable further inquiry and validation.</p>"},{"location":"personal_tax_history/#description-of-search-strategy","title":"Description of Search Strategy","text":"<p>To gather this historical tax information, a multi-pronged search strategy was employed:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Official Government Publications: Priority was given to official sources such as Inland Revenue (IRD) publications, New Zealand Parliamentary Library research papers, and The Treasury working papers. These sources provide authoritative data on tax rates, thresholds, and policy changes. For recent and current rates, the IRD\u2019s online resources (e.g. Tax rates for individuals pages and Tax Information Bulletins) were consulted. Parliamentary research briefs and Budget documents were used to confirm legislated changes at specific dates. The Treasury\u2019s working paper on historical marginal tax rates provided insight into long-term trends since the early 1900s.</p> </li> <li> <p>Historical and Archival Sources: To trace early 20th-century tax rates and major mid-century changes, historical analyses and archives were used. The Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand and NZ History websites were searched for context on early tax laws and wartime tax measures. Academic sources (e.g., research by tax historians) were also considered. A 2012 Treasury working paper was particularly valuable for its summary of historical tax milestones (e.g. introduction of social security tax, WWII tax surcharges, etc.).</p> </li> <li> <p>Legislation and Tax Policy Documents: Key pieces of tax legislation and policy summaries were referenced to pinpoint changes like the introduction of the 39% top rate in 2000, the major income tax cuts in 2010, and threshold adjustments in 2024. The IRD\u2019s Tax Information Bulletins (TIBs) from the 1990s provided granular detail on the transition of tax rate structures (e.g. the reduction of the bottom rate in 1996\u20131998 and the use of low-income rebates). Tax policy websites (taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz) and the New Zealand Legislation website were cross-checked for the exact implementation dates of changes.</p> </li> <li> <p>Contemporary Summaries and Analyses: For recent years and confirmation of current rules, we used summaries from accounting firms (e.g. EY, PwC) and up-to-date Wikipedia entries. These were cross-verified with official data. For example, Wikipedia\u2019s summary of top marginal rate changes provided a quick reference for years in which the top rate changed (which we then verified via official sources). Similarly, private-sector tax guides helped confirm details like the ACC levy rates in recent years, which were ultimately verified against IRD\u2019s official ACC levy rate table.</p> </li> </ul> <p>This blended search strategy ensured coverage of each era of tax history with high confidence in accuracy. Whenever possible, multiple sources were triangulated for each fact (e.g. confirming a tax rate from an official source and a historical commentary). Key search terms included \u201chistorical income tax rates NZ,\u201d \u201cInland Revenue tax thresholds by year,\u201d \u201cWorking for Families introduction,\u201d \u201cACC levy history,\u201d and specific years or acts (e.g., \u201c1891 income tax NZ \u00a3300 exemption\u201d, \u201c1938 Social Security Act tax\u201d, \u201c1988 tax reform New Zealand,\u201d \u201c2024 income tax threshold change NZ\u201d).</p> <p>Errors and gaps were addressed by consulting additional references (for instance, using Treasury publications for pre-1980 data when IRD online material was sparse). If certain data were not explicitly found (e.g., very early 20th-century bracket structures), we relied on aggregated historical summaries from reputable sources, noting where data is limited. Overall, the approach prioritized official data and peer-reviewed historical accounts, using secondary summaries primarily as pointers to the primary sources.</p>"},{"location":"personal_tax_history/#summary-of-findings","title":"Summary of Findings","text":"<p>Evolution of Tax Brackets and Rates: New Zealand\u2019s personal income tax has always been progressive, but both the number of brackets and the tax rates have varied widely. Income tax was first introduced in 1891 with a tax-free threshold of \u00a3300 (exempting most people at the time) and a top rate of just 5% on high incomes. Over the next few decades, rates rose, especially during wartime: by 1921 the top marginal rate was about 43.75%, and on the eve of WWII (1939) it was roughly 42.9%. World War II brought extraordinarily high taxes; a combination of income tax and special levies pushed the effective top marginal rate to around 90% at its peak. Post-war, top rates remained high (around 60\u201376%) until the 1980s. In 1982, the top statutory rate was 60%, which was then raised to 66% in that year (under the Muldoon government).</p> <p>A dramatic shift occurred with the 1980s tax reforms: the top rate was slashed from 66% to 48% in 1988, and then to 33% in 1989. This reform drastically simplified the tax structure \u2013 moving from many brackets to just two steps by the late 1980s \u2013 and was part of a broader \u201cflattening\u201d of the tax system alongside the introduction of GST in 1986. Through the 1990s, the top rate stayed at 33%, while the lower rate was gradually reduced (from 24% in the early 90s down to 19.5% by 1998) and thresholds were modestly adjusted for inflation. By 2000, the bracket structure was: 15% on income up to \\$9,500; 21% on \\$9,501\u2013\\$38,000; 33% on \\$38,001\u2013\\$60,000. In that year, the newly elected government added a 39% top rate on income over \\$60,000, creating four brackets (15, 21, 33, 39%). This 39% rate above \\$60k took effect on 1 April 2000.</p> <p>From 2000 to 2010, those four brackets remained generally stable (with some inflation adjustments in 2008\u20132010). In October 2008, thresholds were raised (e.g. the 15% bracket extended to \\$14,000, and the 21% rate applied up to \\$40,000) as part of legislated tax cuts. A change of government in late 2008 led to further adjustments: effective 1 April 2009, the 39% top rate was reduced to 38%, and the 21% bracket\u2019s upper threshold was increased to \\$48,000. Then on 1 October 2010, a major tax reform lowered rates and simplified brackets: the new rates became 10.5%, 17.5%, 30%, and 33%, with thresholds at \\$14,000, \\$48,000, \\$70,000, and \\$70k+ respectively (the 38% and 39% top rates were removed at that time). This 2010 reform coincided with an increase in GST (12.5% to 15%) and was aimed at shifting the tax mix.</p> <p>From 2011 through 2020, no changes were made to income tax rates or brackets, resulting in a decade of bracket creep as incomes rose with inflation. In 2021, a new top tax rate of 39% was reintroduced on income over \\$180,000, restoring a fifth bracket for the 2021\u201322 tax year onward. This meant the brackets from 2021\u20132023 were: 10.5% (up to \\$14k), 17.5% (\\$14k\u2013\\$48k), 30% (\\$48k\u2013\\$70k), 33% (\\$70k\u2013\\$180k), 39% (\\$180k+). Finally, in mid-2024, the government implemented inflation-indexed threshold adjustments \u2013 the first such adjustment in over a decade. From 1 August 2024, the 10.5% bracket threshold was raised from \\$14,000 to \\$15,600, and the 17.5% bracket upper limit from \\$48,000 to \\$53,500, with slight shifts to the next brackets (the 30% bracket now spanning up to \\$78,100). These mid-year changes led to composite annual rates for the 2024\u201325 income year (e.g., an effective 12.82% rate on \\$14k\u2013\\$15.6k for that year) to reconcile the two part-year rate structures. As of the 2025 tax year, the personal tax rates remain: 10.5% up to \\$15,600; 17.5% \\$15,601\u2013\\$53,500; 30% \\$53,501\u2013\\$78,100; 33% \\$78,101\u2013\\$180,000; 39% over \\$180,000.</p> <p>Tax Credits and Reliefs: New Zealand\u2019s tax system has featured various credits to alleviate tax for certain groups. Early in the 20th century, relief was provided through exemptions (deductions) for dependents, life insurance, etc., rather than credits. By the late 20th century, tax rebates/credits became tools for targeting relief. A low-income earner rebate existed for many years to effectively lower the tax burden on the first few thousand dollars of income \u2013 maintaining an effective 15% bottom rate even when the statutory bottom rate was higher. For example, in the 1996\u20132000 period, the statutory bottom rate was 19.5%, but a rebate ensured those with incomes under \\~\\$9,500 paid effectively 15% on that portion. This rebate was phased out for higher incomes (so higher earners effectively paid 19.5% on their first \\$38k). The low-income rebate was eventually rendered unnecessary when the bottom tax rate was directly set to 15% in 2000; it was later repealed as a formal provision (replaced by tax credits like the IETC) in the early 2010s.</p> <p>Independent Earner Tax Credit (IETC): Introduced on 1 April 2009, the IETC is a tax credit to benefit middle-income earners with no other government support. It provides up to \\$520 per year (approximately \\$10 per week) for individuals with annual income between \\$24,000 and \\$48,000 who are not receiving Working for Families tax credits, income-tested benefits, or NZ Superannuation. The IETC begins to abate at 13c per dollar for income above \\$44,000 and cuts out at \\$48,000. This credit has remained in place through the 2010s (the value and thresholds have not changed since inception), and it effectively boosts the take-home pay of qualifying independent earners by reducing their final tax payable.</p> <p>Working for Families (WFF) Tax Credits: The Working for Families package was launched in 2004\u20132005 as a major reform of family assistance. It consolidated and expanded several child-related tax credits to \u201cmake work pay\u201d and improve income adequacy for families with children. The package (phased in from 2005 to 2007) introduced or rebranded credits including the Family Tax Credit (formerly Family Support), In-Work Tax Credit (replacing an earlier Child Tax Credit for working parents), Minimum Family Tax Credit, and later the Best Start tax credit (from 2018) for families with newborns. Family Tax Credit provides a per-child payment (available to all low-to-middle income families, whether working or on benefits), while the In-Work Tax Credit provides an extra payment to working families that are not on income-tested benefits. These credits abate as family income rises. For example, as of the mid-2010s, the abatement threshold for WFF credits was around \\$36,350, above which credits reduce at 20\u201325% per extra dollar earned (parameters have been adjusted occasionally via Budgets). The Best Start credit, introduced in 2018, provides \\$60 per week for a baby\u2019s first year (universal for all newborns) and for up to three years for lower-income families. Working for Families tax credits are administered jointly by IRD and MSD and are a crucial component of effective tax-benefit policy for families.</p> <p>Other Credits and Notable Deductions: Before WFF, there were other targeted credits such as the Parental Tax Credit (a precursor to Best Start, providing a lump-sum to parents of newborns, now replaced), and the Children\u2019s Tax Credit/Child Tax Credit (which the In-Work Tax Credit replaced in 2006). In earlier decades, New Zealand also had a Tax Reduction for superannuitants in the 1980s and 90s (to partially offset the surcharge on NZ Superannuation), and various small credits (e.g., rebates for charitable donations, housekeeper or childcare rebates in past years \u2013 though most of these were removed in tax simplifications by the 2000s). Most of these are beyond the scope of this summary, which focuses on broad personal tax credits impacting take-home pay.</p> <p>Levies and Mandatory Deductions: New Zealand famously has no general social security tax or separate payroll tax \u2013 funding for pensions and welfare comes from general income tax. However, there have been notable earmarked levies. From 1936 until 1970, a Social Security Contribution (tax) was imposed on incomes to fund the welfare state. Initially set as a flat 5% tax on income in 1939 (on top of regular income tax), it was an evolution of an earlier unemployment levy (which had been 3.33% in the mid-1930s). During WWII this social security tax was increased to 7.5%, and a temporary \u201cNational Security Tax\u201d was also imposed; combined, they reached 12.5% during the war. The social security tax was reduced back to 7.5% after the war and remained at 7.5% until it was abolished in 1970. Effectively, through 1970, wage and salary earners paid an extra levy for social benefits \u2013 by the 1960s it was collected via the PAYE system alongside income tax. After 1970, this dedicated tax was eliminated, and its revenue folded into general tax; the universal benefits (like healthcare and pensions) have since been funded out of general taxation.</p> <p>In 1974, New Zealand introduced the Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC) scheme, replacing the right to sue for personal injuries with a no-fault insurance model. This has been (partly) funded by an earner\u2019s levy on wages and salaries. The ACC Earners\u2019 Levy is a flat percentage charged on employment income up to a certain cap. It is collected alongside PAYE income tax deductions. The levy rate is set annually and has varied over time depending on scheme costs. For example, in the 1990s and 2000s the levy rate generally ranged roughly 1\u20132%. In recent years it has been about 1.21%\u20131.70% (excluding GST) of earnings, equivalent to 1.39% (in 2018\u20132021) up to 1.83% in 2027 when including GST. The maximum earnings subject to ACC also adjusts over time (for instance, in the 2023\u201324 year the levy applied to the first \\$139,384 of earnings). As of 2025, the levy is \\$1.67 per \\$100 of earnings (1.67%), with a maximum levy of \\$2,551 per year (on earnings up to \\$152,790). Employers and self-employed pay separate ACC levies for work injuries (not covered here), but the earners\u2019 levy affects take-home pay for all employees.</p> <p>Aside from ACC, other mandatory deductions that affect take-home pay include KiwiSaver contributions (if the individual opts into KiwiSaver, typically 3\u201310% of pay is deducted, with employer contributions separately) and student loan repayments (12% of income above a threshold for those with student loans). However, these are not taxes per se; they are individualized obligations. We note them for context, but they are not part of the core tax \u201crules\u201d and thresholds covered in this history. There have also been period-specific levies: e.g., during 1975\u20131977, a short-lived \u201cincome levy\u201d helped fund a national superannuation scheme, and in the late 1980s, an \u201cemployment surcharge\u201d temporarily applied. These were generally small and temporary, so the focus remains on the enduring levies like ACC and the historic social security tax.</p> <p>Residents vs. Non-Residents Taxation: New\u00a0Zealand\u2019s tax system taxes individuals based on residency and source. Residents are taxed on their worldwide income, whereas non-residents are taxed only on New\u00a0Zealand-sourced income. Importantly, non-resident individuals earning NZ income generally face the same tax rates and brackets on that income as residents do \u2013 New\u00a0Zealand does not have a separate personal tax scale for non-resident workers. For example, a non-resident earning salary in NZ will have PAYE deducted at the normal progressive rates (and will also pay ACC levy). However, non-residents are typically not eligible for certain tax credits (e.g., they generally cannot claim the Independent Earner Credit or Working for Families unless they meet residency criteria for those credits). Additionally, passive income of non-residents (interest, dividends, royalties) is usually subject to non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) at a flat rate, often reduced by tax treaty agreements. For instance, interest paid to a non-resident is typically taxed via NRWT at 15% (or the Approved Issuer Levy at 2%, if applicable), instead of the progressive rates. New\u00a0Zealand\u2019s approach thus ensures non-residents pay tax on NZ income (with final tax often collected by withholding), but they do not enjoy the full range of resident-specific credits or the tax-free thresholds that some other countries provide (since NZ\u2019s lowest bracket begins above \\$0, everyone pays at least 10.5% on the first dollar earned).</p> <p>In summary, over more than a century, New\u00a0Zealand\u2019s personal tax has moved from a simple exempt amount and flat rate for the few (1890s) to highly complex multi-tier levies (mid-20th century) and back to a simpler broad-base, low-rate system (post-1980s), with the pendulum swinging slightly back to more progressivity in recent years (with new top rates and targeted credits). The tables and timeline below detail the annual rates, thresholds, credits, and levies, and the subsequent sections describe key changes and their context in greater detail. These structured records will enable validation of each year\u2019s tax settings in a microsimulation model and help analysts understand the rationale behind major shifts in policy.</p>"},{"location":"personal_tax_history/#tables-of-tax-rates-thresholds-credits-and-levies","title":"Tables of Tax Rates, Thresholds, Credits, and Levies","text":""},{"location":"personal_tax_history/#personal-income-tax-brackets-and-rates-by-period-nz-residents","title":"Personal Income Tax Brackets and Rates by Period (NZ Residents)","text":"<p>The table below summarizes the marginal tax rates and income brackets for New\u00a0Zealand resident individuals at various key periods.

The initial system was very simple: it featured a generous exemption \u2013 incomes below \u00a3300 (\\~NZ\\$600 at the time, a high bar in 1891) paid no income tax \u2013 and a flat 5% rate on incomes above that level. In effect, only a small fraction of the population (roughly 12,000 individuals out of 700,000 adults) paid any income tax in the 1890s. Most government revenue still came from customs and excise duties on goods during this period.</p> <p>The principle of progression was present from the start (the Land and Income Assessment Act 1891 included progressive land tax rates and a basic progressive income tax), but in practice the income tax was almost flat due to the single threshold. Over the next two decades, the basic structure remained but rates crept up slightly. By 1914, on the eve of World War I, the top rate had risen to about 6.67% \u2013 still relatively low, but indicating a trend toward taxing higher earners more as the need for revenue grew. There were also various exemptions and deductions introduced (for example, tax relief for those with children or life insurance payments, introduced in the early 20th century) to provide some equity and encourage certain behaviors.</p> <p>World War I (1914\u20131918) marked a turning point: the government greatly increased income tax to fund the war effort. Temporary \u201cwar\u201d surcharges effectively multiplied tax liabilities. By 1921, the top marginal rate had leaped to 43.75%. This was a dramatic increase, reflecting how wartime necessity turned income tax from a minor source into a significant revenue tool. However, because the tax thresholds hadn\u2019t lowered enough, still relatively few individuals paid the top rate; it primarily affected the rich.</p> <p>In the 1920s, some of these \u201ctemporary\u201d increases were reversed. There was a conscious policy choice in the 1920s to stimulate post-war economic growth through lower taxes. The top rate was cut back down significantly \u2013 to about 29% by 1930. An interesting structural feature during the 1920s was the use of multi-slope tax scales: instead of distinct brackets with a marginal rate on each slice of income, New\u00a0Zealand had a system where a higher rate could apply to the full income beyond a certain point (this caused discontinuities in effective tax rates). In 1923\u201324, for instance, there was even a one-off 20% rebate on tax to provide relief, demonstrating the ad-hoc measures of the time.</p> <p>By the late 1920s and early 1930s, New\u00a0Zealand, like the rest of the world, was hit by the Great Depression. Tax revenues plummeted and unemployment soared. The government\u2019s response included new taxes: notably, in 1931 a small \u201cUnemployment Tax\u201d of 1.25% was introduced on all incomes. This was essentially a precursor to a social security tax, intended to fund unemployment relief. It was a flat levy (so, regressive in impact) and was increased in steps in the early 1930s. By the time the first Labour Government came to power in 1935, this unemployment levy had reached 3.33% (3\u2153%) on income. Labour, with its more welfare-focused agenda, maintained and repurposed this levy rather than removing it.</p>"},{"location":"personal_tax_history/#1930s1940s-social-security-and-war-high-taxation-era","title":"1930s\u20131940s: Social Security and War \u2013 High Taxation Era","text":"<p>A watershed moment in tax policy came with the Social Security Act 1938. From 1 April 1939, New\u00a0Zealand implemented a broad-based Social Security Contribution \u2013 effectively a national tax earmarked to fund the new welfare state (age pensions, free healthcare, family benefits, etc.). This replaced the earlier unemployment tax. The social security tax was set at 5% on all income (initially), and accompanied by a flat charge of \u00a31 per person (often called a \u201cpoll tax\u201d or registration fee). These measures ensured that even people with modest incomes contributed something to the welfare scheme, though the income tax exemptions and graduated rates still meant the wealthy paid more. The introduction of social security taxation in 1939 marks the start of dual taxes on income: a standard income tax (with graduated rates) and a parallel flat tax for social services.</p> <p>When World War II erupted, New\u00a0Zealand\u2019s fiscal needs surged again. The government layered on \u201cNational Security Tax\u201d and other surcharges. For example, in 1940 a National Security Tax effectively added an extra 0.5 shillings per pound (i.e., 2.5%), later rising, on top of existing taxes. By 1942-43, the social security tax had been hiked to 7.5%, and an additional \u201cincome tax charge\u201d was levied at 33\u2153% of the income tax liability (i.e., if your calculated income tax was \u00a3100, you paid an extra \u00a333). This combination yielded extremely high effective tax rates for top earners. The statutory top income tax rate was raised to 60% during the war, but if one adds 7.5% social security + 33% surtax on the income tax, the effective top marginal rate exceeded 90% in the mid-war years. Indeed, for a few years (1942\u20131946) New\u00a0Zealand arguably had a near confiscatory top tax rate \u2013 something that was justified publicly by the needs of total war. Even middle incomes faced heavy taxation: the overlapping of taxes meant someone in the middle bracket might pay a base rate of 30% plus the 7.5% social security, etc. Notably, four years (1942\u20131945) saw the top effective marginal rate above 90%, the highest in NZ\u2019s history.</p> <p>Structurally, a significant change during WWII was the simplification of the rate schedule in 1940. The old multi-slope system was replaced in 1940 by a more straightforward multi-step scale (graduated brackets), but it still had 40 separate income steps up to the 60% top rate. This was an attempt to make the tax easier to compute while retaining progression. In practice, the combination of 40 brackets and extra levies meant complexity remained.</p> <p>After WWII, the extra war surcharges were gradually removed by the early 1950s (the temporary additional income tax levy ended in 1953). The social security tax was brought back down to its peacetime 7.5% and stayed at that rate. The top marginal income tax rate, which had been 60% since the 1940s, was slightly reduced in the late 1940s and 1950s: it fluctuated but generally remained in the range of 55\u201360%. One source notes the top rate was about 76.5% at the end of the 1940s and then \u201cgenerally lower\u201d in the post-war period. In practice, the top statutory rate settled around 60% throughout the 1950s and 60s, and since the social security levy was a separate flat 7.5%, one could say the combined top rate was effectively \\~67.5% on the last dollar of earnings.</p> <p>A notable administrative reform was the introduction of PAYE (Pay As You Earn) withholding in 1958. Before 1958, employees would receive their full wages and then had to settle income tax afterward (often in a lump sum or provisional installments). This was onerous and led to compliance issues. PAYE required employers to deduct income tax (and social security tax) each payday. The immediate effect was that in 1958 many taxpayers paid two years\u2019 worth of tax (the prior year in arrears and current year via PAYE), an event softened by transitional credits. PAYE greatly improved tax compliance and made the process more convenient \u2013 it\u2019s arguably one of the biggest practical changes in tax collection (though not a rate change per se).</p>"},{"location":"personal_tax_history/#1950s1960s-post-war-adjustments-and-stability","title":"1950s\u20131960s: Post-war Adjustments and Stability","text":"<p>The period from the mid-1940s to the early 1970s can be seen as one of high but stable taxes. New\u00a0Zealand was building a comprehensive welfare state, and the revenue largely came from direct taxes on income. The top marginal income tax rate stayed in the 55\u201360% range, and the 7.5% social security tax persisted. Bracket thresholds were occasionally raised (often by amendments in annual tax Acts) to account for inflation, but not systematically. Inflation was moderate enough in the 1950s that bracket creep was not yet a political focus.</p> <p>By the early 1960s, the government did enact some income tax relief. For instance, in 1961 the Holyoake Government raised personal exemptions (which effectively lifted the tax-free income portion, thereby reducing tax for low earners) \u2013 this caused a dip in average tax rates in 1962\u201363. There were also across-the-board upward shifts in brackets in 1962 to counter bracket creep. These changes interrupted the rising trend of tax burdens temporarily.</p> <p>However, the general pattern until the 1970s was that as incomes grew, more people paid higher average rates \u2013 the phenomenon of bracket creep \u2013 because rate thresholds were not indexed to inflation. One indicator: in the early 1950s, a relatively small share of workers reached the top bracket, but by the late 1960s many more did, simply due to wage growth pushing them into higher tax brackets without any change in law.</p> <p>One structural change was that by 1970, the Social Security tax of 7.5% was abolished. This happened under the National Government\u2019s 1970 budget reforms, which folded that revenue into ordinary income tax. Essentially, the nominal income tax rates were raised by 7.5 percentage points and the separate levy dropped. In effect, it was largely a bookkeeping change \u2013 people\u2019s take-home pay didn\u2019t increase by 7.5%, because regular tax went up accordingly \u2013 but it simplified the system by having only one set of tax calculations instead of two.

For example, in 1975, marginal rates ranged from 15% at the low end up to about 60% at the top (the top threshold might have been around NZ\\$20,000 at the time \u2013 high income for that era). The number of brackets was large (dozens of small increments). The late 1970s saw economic turbulence (oil shocks, inflation). Tax policy responded occasionally: the 1978 and 1979 budgets slightly adjusted tax rates and introduced an indexing of thresholds (the income tax was partially indexed to inflation in 1980 by the Muldoon government, but subsequently suspended as inflation soared). A noteworthy feature was the Superannuation surcharge introduced in 1976: while not directly a personal income tax rate, it effectively taxed other income of pensioners at a high rate (up to 25%) to claw back some of the universal pension. This was a controversial policy that lasted until 1998, illustrating how the tax-welfare system intersected.</p> <p>By 1982, New\u00a0Zealand\u2019s top marginal rate reached a historical high in peacetime: 66% on income over approximately NZ\\$38,000. This came from a decision by Robert Muldoon\u2019s National Government to increase the top rate from 60% to 66% in 1982 to raise revenue (the country was facing fiscal deficits). At that time, New\u00a0Zealand\u2019s income tax was among the highest in the OECD. The basic rate structure in 1982 was roughly: 20% on low incomes, scaling up through many brackets to 66% at the top. Many ordinary middle-class earners were in 40\u201350% marginal tax brackets due to bracket creep and multiple steps.</p> <p>1984 brought a change of government (the Fourth Labour Government) and with it a radical shift in economic policy. Over 1984\u20131988, New\u00a0Zealand underwent major tax reform as part of \u201cRogernomics.\u201d This reform had several prongs:</p> <ul> <li>Introduction of GST (Goods and Services Tax) at 10% in 1986 (later 12.5% in 1989 and 15% in 2010).</li> <li>Removal or reduction of many special tax exemptions and deductions to broaden the tax base (e.g., removing preferential treatment of certain savings, life insurance, etc.).</li> <li>Dramatic cuts to marginal income tax rates to a \u201cbroad-base, low-rate\u201d philosophy.</li> </ul> <p>In October 1986, an interim step of tax reduction occurred (top rate cut to 48% then) along with GST introduction, but the most dramatic changes were in 1988 and 1989. From 1 April 1988, the top personal rate fell from 48% to 40%, and one year later, on 1 April 1989, it fell again to 33%. Concurrently, the number of brackets was slashed \u2013 ultimately to just two brackets by 1989 (and briefly a third very low bracket with a zero rate via rebate). Graphically, the top rate plummeted (see the timeline diagram below) from the mid-60s to the low 30s within a couple of years. This was one of the largest tax rate cuts in NZ\u2019s history.</p> <p> Figure 1: Top Personal Income Tax Rate Over Time (1900\u20132025). The timeline of New\u00a0Zealand\u2019s top marginal tax rate shows a peak of 90%+ during WWII, a post-war norm of \\~60%, a spike to 66% in the early 1980s, then a sharp drop to 33% by 1989. Subsequent decades saw a rise to 39% in 2000, a fall to 33% in 2010, and a return to 39% in 2021. (Source data: NZ Parliamentary Library, Treasury; compiled by author.)</p> <p>Accompanying the rate cuts, tax credits and surcharges were restructured. The low-income earner rebate was introduced (ensuring those under \\$9,500 effectively paid 15% or less). Family Support credits were introduced in 1986 to help low-income families in lieu of universal family benefit (a precursor to Working for Families). On the other end, a surtax on state pensions (the superannuitant surcharge) was implemented to target benefits to those in need \u2013 effectively part of the tax system\u2019s role in means-testing.</p> <p>The philosophy of the 1986\u20131990 reforms was to remove distortions: having much lower top rates was intended to reduce tax avoidance and spur investment. Indeed, prior to 1988, the gap between the top personal (66%) and company tax rate (48%) induced many to shelter income in companies or trusts. By 1989, both the top personal and company rate converged at 33%, eliminating the incentive to arbitrage between entity types. New\u00a0Zealand achieved one of the flattest income tax structures in the world at that time.</p>"},{"location":"personal_tax_history/#1990s-tweaks-and-targeted-relief","title":"1990s: Tweaks and Targeted Relief","text":"<p>In the 1990s, the broad structure from 1989 remained in place initially: a top rate of 33%, bottom rate 24% (later reduced), and few brackets. The incoming National Government in 1990 did not reverse the low top rate; instead, they focused on targeted tax relief and further base-broadening. One significant change was the introduction of the Independent Family Tax Credit (also known as Child Tax Credit) in 1996, which was a payment to working families not on welfare (a precursor to the In-Work Tax Credit).</p> <p>Tax bracket adjustments in the 90s were modest: inflation had reduced the real value of thresholds, so in 1996\u20131998, as part of a coalition agreement (\u201cCredible Budget\u201d and \u201cTax Reduction and Social Policy Programme\u201d), the National Government reduced the bottom tax rate and raised thresholds. Specifically, from 1 July 1996 the bottom rate dropped from 24% to 21.5%, and the threshold for 33% was raised from \\$30,875 to \\$34,200. Then from 1 July 1997, the bottom rate further dropped to 19.5%, and the 19.5% bracket\u2019s ceiling rose to \\$38,000. By 1 April 1998, the rates were stabilized at 19.5% up to \\$38,000, and 33% above \\$38,000 (with a low-income rebate making the effective lowest rate 15% for incomes under \\$9,500). The corporate tax rate was also reduced to 33% in this period, keeping it aligned with the top personal rate.</p> <p>These changes in the late 90s were partly offset by the retention of the superannuation surcharge (until 1998) and the introduction of some user-pays in other areas. But overall, personal income tax remained relatively low and flat by historical standards.</p> <p>An important development in 1999\u20132000 was that the new Labour-Alliance coalition, elected in 1999, campaigned on requiring high earners to contribute a fairer share. Thus, from 1 April 2000, a new top tax bracket of 39% for income over \\$60,000 was introduced. This raised the number of brackets to four and was projected to affect roughly 5% of taxpayers at the time. The government justified it on equity grounds and to fund social programs. The 33% rate was kept for incomes \\$38,000\u2013\\$60,000, the 21% for \\$9,500\u2013\\$38,000, and 15% below \\$9,500. Notably, the low-income rebate was adjusted so that those above \\$38k no longer got the benefit (hence the note that the first \\$38k was taxed at 19.5% for them). The net effect: between 2000 and 2008, the tax structure was more progressive at the top than it had been in the 90s, but still much flatter than the 1970s.</p> <p>During the early 2000s, aside from the new top rate, the Labour government made few changes to income tax brackets, allowing bracket creep to gradually increase revenue (fiscal drag became a political issue by mid-decade as wages grew and more people started paying 33% or 39%). Instead, policy focus was on targeted assistance via the transfer system \u2013 notably the Working for Families package (2004\u201307). WFF significantly increased tax credits for families (Family Support became more generous, In-Work Tax Credit introduced, etc.), which reduced effective tax burdens for working families with children (often yielding negative income tax for some, i.e., net subsidies). In essence, while statutory tax rates stayed the same from 2000 to 2008, effective taxes for low-to-middle income families dropped thanks to WFF.</p> <p>By 2005\u20132008, accumulating fiscal surpluses and political pressure to address bracket creep led to promised tax cuts. The 2008 Budget (by Labour) scheduled phased tax rate cuts: effective 1 October 2008, 1 April 2010, and 1 April 2011. The first phase (Oct 2008) happened: the bottom rate went from 15% to 12.5%, and thresholds were raised (bringing the \\$60k threshold to \\$70k, etc.). But Labour lost the 2008 election, and the new National Government canceled the later phases. Instead, National implemented its own tax package.</p>"},{"location":"personal_tax_history/#2010-comprehensive-tax-reform-and-modern-structure","title":"2010: Comprehensive Tax Reform and Modern Structure","text":"<p>After some interim tweaks in 2009 (notably the introduction of the Independent Earner Tax Credit in April 2009 and a cut of the top rate to 38%), the big change came on 1 October 2010. The 2010 reform under Prime Minister John Key and Finance Minister Bill English was one of the largest since 1989. It aimed to be broadly revenue-neutral in tandem with a GST increase. Key features:</p> <ul> <li>The GST rate increased from 12.5% to 15% (effective the same day).</li> <li>Personal income tax rates were all reduced: the 12.5% became 10.5%; 21% became 17.5%; 33% became 30%; and 38% (top) became 33%. This left the top rate equal to the company tax (which was cut to 28% in 2011) for a while, reducing arbitrage.</li> <li>Brackets were adjusted slightly: the threshold for 17.5% was set at \\$48,000 (was to be \\$50k under Labour\u2019s canceled plan, but \\$48k was chosen to align with a round number and fiscal considerations), and the 30% bracket still started at \\$48k up to \\$70k, with 33% above \\$70k.</li> <li>The Independent Earner Credit was retained as is, and WFF tax credits were initially untouched (though subsequently slightly trimmed in 2011\u20132012 for higher incomes).</li> </ul> <p>This created the four-bracket structure (10.5, 17.5, 30, 33) that endured for the next decade. Combined with WFF and IETC, the system in the 2010s delivered lower effective tax rates for most, except that very high earners benefited substantially from the top rate drop (from 38 to 33). The equity concern was partially addressed through the GST compensation via income support and the fact that top earners lost some tax preferences (like property depreciation deductions) in parallel reforms.</p> <p>New\u00a0Zealand from 2010 to 2020 had no further major changes in personal tax brackets or rates. This was an unusual decade of stability. Over these years, inflation and wage growth pushed more income into the higher brackets (e.g., by 2020 a full-time minimum wage worker could easily be in the 17.5% bracket, and middle managers hit the 33% bracket). The absence of indexation meant bracket creep once again became a talking point, with estimates that by 2020 a large fraction of taxpayers were in the 30% bracket, which was originally intended for \u201cabove average\u201d incomes in 2010.</p>"},{"location":"personal_tax_history/#20212025-return-of-a-higher-top-rate-and-threshold-adjustments","title":"2021\u20132025: Return of a Higher Top Rate and Threshold Adjustments","text":"<p>In the 2020 election, the Labour Party (under Jacinda Ardern) proposed a new top tax rate for high earners. Consequently, from 1 April 2021, a 39% rate on income above \\$180,000 was implemented. This reintroduced a fifth bracket (the first since 2010) and affected roughly the top 2% of earners. The rationale was to increase revenue from those most able to contribute, especially in light of COVID-19 fiscal pressures, while leaving lower and middle rates unchanged. With this change, New\u00a0Zealand\u2019s top marginal tax rate returned to the same level it had been in 2000\u20132010, albeit at a much higher threshold (\\$180k now, vs \\$60k then \u2013 capturing a much smaller proportion of taxpayers).</p> <p>From 2021 through 2023, the rate brackets stayed the same (10.5, 17.5, 30, 33, 39) and the thresholds remained at 2010 levels for the lower brackets and \\$180k for the new top. This meant that by 2023, it had been 13 years since the \\$14k, \\$48k, \\$70k thresholds were set \u2013 over which time inflation cumulatively was significant. The lack of adjustment effectively increased tax burdens in real terms for low and middle earners each year (fiscal drag).</p> <p>Acknowledging this, in 2023\u20132024 there was cross-party consensus emerging on adjusting brackets. The Government announced that from 31 July 2024, the first two bracket thresholds would be raised: the 10.5% rate\u2019s upper limit from \\$14,000 to \\$15,600, and the 17.5% rate\u2019s upper limit from \\$48,000 to \\$53,500. The 30% bracket consequently now covers \\$53,501 to \\$78,100 (previously it was \\$48k to \\$70k), and the 33% bracket covers \\$78,101 to \\$180,000. These specific increases were roughly in line with cumulative CPI inflation since 2010 (about +11%). They took effect mid-tax-year (Aug 2024), which, as noted earlier, led IRD to use composite annual rates for the 2024\u201325 year to ensure no over/under-taxation at year-end. For example, the \u201cannualized\u201d marginal rate for \\$14k\u2013\\$15.6k in that year was 12.82%, a blend of 17.5% for four months and 10.5% for eight months.</p> <p>Alongside these threshold adjustments, no further changes to rates were made for 2025. The 39% top rate remains, and notably its threshold (\\$180k) was not altered in 2024. There was also an increase in the ACC levy around 2024\u201325 (as seen in the ACC table, rates tick up yearly), but that is separate from income tax changes. Looking forward, any future government may consider indexing the tax brackets to inflation to avoid bracket creep \u2013 a policy that existed briefly in the 1980s but has not been adopted long-term.</p> <p>In summary, by 2025 New\u00a0Zealand\u2019s personal tax structure is mildly progressive: a low starter rate (10.5%) that ensures everyone pays some tax from the first dollar (NZ has no tax-free allowance), a middle band of 17.5% and 30% covering most full-time workers\u2019 incomes, a 33% upper-middle rate, and a 39% top rate hitting only high earners. Combined with significant tax credits (WFF) and transfers, the system\u2019s overall progressivity is higher than the raw rates suggest, but compared to the mid-20th century, statutory rates are low and the structure simpler. Over more than a century, New\u00a0Zealand has thus gone from a \u201cexempt the many, lightly tax the few\u201d approach (1890s), to \u201ctax almost everyone heavily\u201d (WWII era), to \u201clow flat-ish taxes\u201d (late 1980s-90s), and now towards a moderate middle ground.</p> <p>To visualize the structural shifts, the Mermaid diagram below presents a timeline of significant personal tax milestones in New\u00a0Zealand:</p> <pre><code>timeline\n    title New Zealand Personal Tax System \u2013 Key Milestones\n    1891 : Income Tax introduced (Liberal govt). \u00a3300 exemption; 5% top rate:contentReference[oaicite:217]{index=217}\n    1917 : WWI \u201cspecial war tax\u201d pushes top rate &gt; 30%:contentReference[oaicite:218]{index=218}\n    1931 : Depression-era taxes \u2013 1.25% unemployment levy starts:contentReference[oaicite:219]{index=219}\n    1939 : Social Security tax 5% + \u00a31 poll tax fund welfare\n    1942 : WWII peak: 60% income tax + 12.5% social/war levies (top EMTR ~100%):contentReference[oaicite:221]{index=221}\n    1958 : PAYE system introduced \u2013 wage tax withheld at source:contentReference[oaicite:222]{index=222}\n    1970 : Social Security levy (7.5%) abolished; folded into income tax:contentReference[oaicite:223]{index=223}\n    1982 : Top rate 66% (historic high in peacetime):contentReference[oaicite:224]{index=224}\n    1988 : GST introduced (1986); top rate cut to 48%:contentReference[oaicite:225]{index=225}\n    1989 : Top rate 33%; two-step tax scale achieved:contentReference[oaicite:226]{index=226}\n    2000 : New 39% top rate over $60k (four brackets):contentReference[oaicite:227]{index=227}\n    2005 : Working for Families boosts family tax credits:contentReference[oaicite:228]{index=228}\n    2010 : Comprehensive reform \u2013 GST 15%, bottom rate 10.5%, top rate down to 33%:contentReference[oaicite:229]{index=229}\n    2021 : 39% top rate re-introduced over $180k:contentReference[oaicite:230]{index=230}\n    2024 : Tax bracket thresholds indexed ~11% upward (first adjustment since 2010):contentReference[oaicite:231]{index=231}\n</code></pre> <p>(Figure 2: Timeline of Key Tax Changes) \u2013 This timeline highlights major changes: introduction (1891), wartime surcharges, the first social security tax (1939), removal of that tax (1970), the 1980s overhaul (top rate to 33%), the 2000 and 2010 shifts, and the recent reintroduction of a higher top bracket and inflation indexing.</p> <p>Each of these milestones corresponded to changes in economic philosophy or circumstances.

By 1970, the Social Security Income Tax (a flat payroll tax introduced in 1939) had been merged with income tax (phased out by 1969), simplifying PAYE deductions. The National Government (PM Keith Holyoake, Finance Minister Robert Muldoon) faced inflation and balance of payments pressures.</li> <li>Tax Rates and Thresholds: The 1970 Budget announced major income tax reforms to take effect the following year. These included a drastic cut in the top marginal rate from about 70% (including social security tax) down to 50%, and a collapse of many small tax brackets into fewer, broader bands. The restructuring aimed to modernize the 1950s/60s tax scale, which had featured a tax-free allowance and steep graduation up to \\~65\u201370%. The new scale (effective 1971) would have a top rate of 50c/\\$ and fewer, wider brackets.</li> <li>Levies and Rebates: In October 1970, facing rising inflation, Muldoon introduced a crisis mini-budget with a temporary income tax surcharge. From December 1970 to July 1971, all income tax rates were surcharged 10% for four months (equating to a 3\u2153% rise on an annual basis). This lifted the top rate from 67.5% to an effective 74.25% during that period (or \\~69.75% averaged over the year).

Low-income earners still enjoyed a basic personal exemption (\\$275) and other allowances, but the first taxable income bracket now started at a lower marginal rate (the precise bottom rate was set around 10\u201315%). The temporary 10% tax surcharge continued until 31 July 1971, then expired as scheduled. Thus, for part of the 1971\u201372 income year, taxpayers paid slightly higher composite rates due to the surcharge.</li> <li>Levies and Policy Changes: The 1971 tax scale was part of a broader reform package. Concurrently, the government enacted a controversial payroll tax on employers in 1971. Muldoon introduced a flat-rate payroll tax of 4\u20135% on wages (often cited at 3.5% initially) to curb inflation by restraining wage growth. This payroll tax was separate from income tax and intended as an anti-inflation device (effectively a surcharge on employers\u2019 wage bills).

Starting 1 April 1974 (1974/75 tax year), Labour abolished the tax-free allowance of \\$275 and the lowest tax bracket, replacing them with a non-refundable tax credit of \\$125 for every individual. This credit functioned like a \u201creverse tax\u201d on initial earnings \u2013 effectively making the first \\$ \\~690 of income tax-free (since 18% of \\$690 \u2248 \\$124). To accommodate this, the first dollar of income became taxable at 18%, whereas previously income up to \\$275 was exempt. The top rate remained 50%, and the overall rate scale was made less steeply graduated (Rowling described it as a \u201cplateau\u201d scale). In short, from 1974 the tax schedule had fewer, broader brackets, with low-income earners benefiting from the flat \\$125 credit but facing a higher initial marginal rate (18% instead of 0%). For the 1973\u201374 income year itself, the old structure persisted (top 50%, allowances intact).</li> <li>Tax Credits and Levies: The \\$125 tax credit was a landmark introduction \u2013 essentially a universal tax rebate that reduced tax for all taxpayers, especially benefitting low earners (it offset the tax on income up to \\$690). This move shifted support to low-income individuals directly through the tax system, a precursor to later tax credits. Meanwhile, Muldoon\u2019s payroll tax was repealed as promised \u2013 Labour eliminated the employer payroll tax in early 1973, viewing it as inflationary and unfair. This removal was one of the first acts of the Kirk government and was widely welcomed by businesses (Muldoon himself later admitted the payroll tax had been a mistake). No major new levies were added; there was still no general social security tax (funding for welfare was now entirely from general income tax).</li> <li>Political Notes: Labour\u2019s tax changes reflected its philosophy of \u201cgiving something back\u201d to low earners while maintaining progressivity. The shift to a tax credit (rather than an allowance) was innovative \u2013 it increased take-home pay for low-income workers without creating a tax-free band (all income was taxed, but the credit then offset that tax for the first portion). This was done in a high-inflation environment (inflation over 10%), where not indexing brackets meant fiscal drag; the credit helped counteract that for low incomes. Politically, 1973 saw robust social policy expansion (e.g., introduction of domestic purposes benefit), with tax policy supporting those goals.</li> <li>Certainty: High. The introduction of the \\$125 tax credit and removal of the tax-free allowance are explicitly detailed in historical analyses. Parliamentary records document the repeal of the payroll tax in 1973. Multiple sources (e.g., Rankin, 2014) discuss the 1973 tax reform as a pivotal change in structure.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"personal_tax_history_1970-25_narrative/#1974","title":"1974","text":"<ul> <li>Tax Rates and Thresholds: On 1 April 1974, the new tax structure from the 1973 Budget took effect. Thus, for the 1974\u201375 tax year, every taxpayer received a \\$125 tax credit and faced an 18% marginal tax rate on the first dollar of income (up to \\~\\$1,000 of income, after which higher brackets applied). The top marginal rate remained 50%, but because the low and middle brackets had been consolidated, the 50% rate kicked in at a higher income threshold than before (providing relief to middle earners). The rate schedule in 1974\u201375 was a \u201cplateau\u201d \u2013 meaning it had a long flat section of 18% for lower incomes after the credit, then a few higher steps up to 50%. (Exact brackets for 1974/75: first \\~\\$1,000 effectively tax-free via credit; income beyond that taxed 18% up to a certain point, then intermediate rates (likely around 30% and 40%), then 50% at the top. These details are inferred from the plateau concept and prior structure.)</li> <li>New Levies \u2013 ACC: A major development was the start of the Accident Compensation scheme. On 1 April 1974, the government implemented the Accident Compensation Act 1972, launching a no-fault injury insurance system (ACC). ACC levies commenced: employers paid levies on payroll for work injuries, and a flat earners\u2019 levy was introduced on employees\u2019 incomes to fund non-work injuries. For example, in 1974 the earners\u2019 levy was set at 0.8% of earnings (up to a cap). This levy was collected alongside PAYE tax. In essence, 1974 saw the substitution of prior accident insurance premiums and common-law liabilities with a state-run ACC funded by these levies. (The ACC earners\u2019 levy is mandatory and functions like an additional income tax earmarked for accident insurance.)</li> <li>Tax Credits: Beyond the \\$125 personal credit (in place throughout 1974), no new tax credits were added in 1974. Family-related tax relief still took the form of universal Family Benefit payments (not part of the tax system) and some dependent rebates, but Family Support credits did not yet exist (they would come in 1980s).</li> <li>Superannuation Scheme: In August 1974, Labour also legislated a contributory New Zealand Superannuation Scheme (not to be confused with today\u2019s NZ Super pension). Starting in late 1974 and early 1975, employees and employers each had to contribute 4% of earnings to a fund for future retirement benefits. This was essentially a payroll deduction (like a compulsory savings tax) intended to prefund pensions. It began operation in April 1975; contributions were collected via the PAYE system (effectively another levy on wages). This scheme was short-lived (as noted below, it was dismantled in 1976 by the next government).</li> <li>Political Notes: Labour\u2019s aggressive reforms in 1974 aimed to expand social security (ACC, pension scheme) and make the tax system more equitable. The ACC introduction replaced the previous mix of common-law remedies and private accident insurance with a universal scheme (an important shift in social policy). Politically, 1974 was tumultuous: PM Norman Kirk died in August, and Bill Rowling became Prime Minister. Economic warning signs (oil shock, inflation &gt; 15%) were emerging, straining the budget \u2013 but no income tax rate increases were made, relying instead on growth and new levies for revenue.</li> <li>Certainty: High. The implementation of the \\$125 credit and 1974/75 tax scale is documented in tax history analyses. The launch of ACC on 1 April 1974 and associated levies is confirmed by official sources. The contributory superannuation scheme details (4% contributions) are recorded in historical accounts.

However, high inflation (over 15%) was causing \u201cfiscal drag\u201d \u2013 many workers\u2019 incomes rose into higher tax brackets, increasing their effective tax rates without any law change. The Labour government did not adjust thresholds for inflation in 1975, which swelled tax revenue but eroded after-tax incomes.</li> <li>Tax Credits: The \\$125 personal tax credit continued in force, unchanged from its 1974 value. Family and dependent-related rebates were also unchanged. One new support measure outside the tax code was the introduction of income-related rebates on residential mortgage interest in 1975 (as part of anti-inflation measures), but this was administered via the tax system for qualifying homeowners (a niche policy, soon abolished by the next government).</li> <li>Levies and Superannuation: Contributions to the new Superannuation Scheme (4%+4%) began in April 1975, so throughout 1975 wage earners and employers were paying into this fund via PAYE deductions. These contributions were essentially mandatory retirement savings, not a tax per se, but it felt like an extra 4% payroll levy to employees. The ACC levies (earner\u2019s levy and employer levy) also continued. Notably, October 1975 saw universal National Superannuation enacted (to replace the contributory scheme) \u2013 Labour, anticipating an election, passed the National Superannuation Act 1975 which guaranteed from 1977 a universal pension at 80% of the average wage for a married couple. This had future fiscal implications (and was a point of debate in the election), but in 1975 itself it did not alter taxes; it was to be funded by general taxation in the future.</li> <li>Political Context: 1975 was an election year. Economic troubles (rampant inflation, looming deficits) dominated. The Labour government\u2019s popularity waned, and in the November 1975 election, Robert Muldoon\u2019s National Party won a landslide. National campaigned on repealing Labour\u2019s superannuation savings scheme (calling it a \u201ctax on jobs\u201d) and on increasing the universal pension (National Super) funded out of general tax. Muldoon also promised tax relief via indexing or cuts, though specifics were vague. Immediately after the election (which took place late in the calendar year), Muldoon became Prime Minister and Finance Minister, but no tax changes occurred in the final weeks of 1975.</li> <li>Certainty: High. The maintenance of the 1974 tax scale through 1975 is supported by sources noting the same plateau structure into 1976. The operation of the contributory pension scheme (4% contributions) in 1975 is documented in social policy histories. National\u2019s stated intentions (repeal of the scheme, pension policy) are well-recorded in campaign literature and later legislative action.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"personal_tax_history_1970-25_narrative/#1976","title":"1976","text":"<ul> <li>Tax Rates and Thresholds: In early 1976, the new National Government kept the existing tax scale temporarily unchanged \u2013 18% bottom marginal (after credit) and 50% top. However, Muldoon did not increase the \\$125 tax credit or adjust brackets for inflation, meaning effective tax burdens rose via fiscal drag. By the 1976\u201377 tax year, inflation nearing 13% pushed many taxpayers into higher average tax rates, increasing revenue without explicit rate hikes. There were no legislated changes to personal income tax rates in 1976.</li> <li>Policy Reversals \u2013 Superannuation: A major policy action was the repeal of Labour\u2019s contributory superannuation scheme. In December 1975 (immediately after taking office) and into 1976, Muldoon\u2019s government passed legislation abolishing the compulsory 4% earnings levy for the pension fund. Contributions ceased as of 1 April 1976, and contributions already made were eventually refunded or absorbed. This removed the extra payroll deduction on employees/employers. Instead, Muldoon introduced \u201cNational Superannuation\u201d \u2013 a universal pension for those 60+ funded from general taxation, to commence April 1977. While this didn\u2019t immediately change income tax rates, it implied higher tax funding needs in the future. In the interim, the government planned to finance it by other means (borrowing and hoping for growth).</li> <li>Tax Credits and Levies: The \\$125 personal tax credit was still in place throughout 1976. Muldoon did not eliminate it (despite some ideological opposition to universal credits), likely because removing it would mean a de facto tax increase on low earners. ACC levies continued (with some adjustments: e.g., 1976 saw minor tweaks to levy classes, but the earner\u2019s levy rate remained around 1%). No new credits were introduced. However, Muldoon signaled a shift from universal tax relief to targeted relief. Notably, he soon planned to replace the universal tax credit with targeted rebates (this occurred in 1978).</li> <li>Political Notes: The focus in 1976 was on economic stabilization. The new government implemented a wage-price freeze (temporarily) and other interventions. On tax, Muldoon\u2019s early budgets were cautious; despite prior talk of indexing tax brackets to inflation, he did not do so in 1976, preferring to bank the extra revenue to fund National Super and other promises. Public expectations of tax cuts were tempered by the fiscal situation. Muldoon did introduce some minor indirect tax increases (e.g., on alcohol/tobacco) in 1976 to raise revenue. The overall strategy was to fulfill costly pension promises without overtly raising income tax rates \u2013 meaning reliance on inflation and economic growth to boost tax take (a phenomenon critics dubbed \u201cbracket creep\u201d).</li> <li>Certainty: High. The continuity of the 1974\u201376 tax rates is evidenced in Rankin\u2019s analysis (showing the same structure through 1976/77). The repeal of the 1974 super scheme in 1976 is a well-documented event. Parliamentary records from 1976 (the Budget) show no changes in income tax rates, which aligns with contemporary accounts of Muldoon using fiscal drag to his advantage.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"personal_tax_history_1970-25_narrative/#1977","title":"1977","text":"<ul> <li>Tax Rates and Thresholds: Still no change to statutory income tax rates in 1977. The marginal rates remained 18% (initial bracket after credit) up to 50% (top) \u2013 the structure introduced by Labour in 1974 was essentially intact until Muldoon decided on a new approach in 1978. 1977 was the third year in a row of high inflation (\\~15\u201318%) with frozen brackets, so fiscal drag significantly increased revenue and pushed many middle-income earners into higher marginal tax steps. Muldoon\u2019s government quietly benefited from this bracket creep to finance spending, though it was eroding take-home pay.</li> <li>Tax Credits and Rebates: The universal \\$125 tax credit remained in place through most of 1977. However, facing political pressure to ease the tax burden, Muldoon provided a small one-off tax rebate late in the 1977\u201378 fiscal year. Specifically, he authorized a 5% income tax rebate for the last two months of the tax year (February\u2013March 1978). This effectively gave wage earners a modest refund (5% of PAYE) for that period, partially offsetting fiscal drag. The rebate was in the style of earlier 1960s rebates \u2013 a temporary percentage reduction in tax, capped for the year (the 1977 version applied only to the tail end of the year). Its practical effect was minor (roughly a 0.8% tax cut for the full year) but it acknowledged taxpayer frustration. Aside from this, no new credits were introduced in 1977.</li> <li>Levies: ACC levies continued as before. National Superannuation (universal pension) began 1 April 1977: while not a levy, it meant from 1977 onward a significant portion of income tax revenue was earmarked to pay generous pensions. The cost was high, but the government did not impose a new tax to fund it, relying instead on general revenue (and borrowing).</li> <li>Political Context: 1977 was a non-election year but politically tense due to economic stagnation (low growth, high inflation). The National Government began considering a major overhaul of the tax system to deal with bracket creep and incentivize work. Muldoon convened the McCaw Taskforce on Tax Reform in 1977, which would report in 1978. In the meantime, the late-1977 token tax rebate was likely aimed at assuaging the public before the 1978 election. Also of note, by 1977 unemployment was rising to unprecedented levels (though still low by later standards), which, combined with inflation, created a sense of crisis. Muldoon\u2019s public stance was that he would adjust taxes when prudent; privately, plans were afoot for a significant tax restructuring in 1978.</li> <li>Certainty: High. The lack of structural changes in 1977 and the 5% two-month rebate are recorded in economic histories. The temporary rebate for Mar 1978 is confirmed by Rankin (2014). The McCaw Taskforce existence and timing are part of the public record (tasked in 1977, reported 1978). No conflicting accounts were found, and multiple analyses note the continued use of fiscal drag in this period.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"personal_tax_history_1970-25_narrative/#1978","title":"1978","text":"<ul> <li>Tax Rates and Structure: Major reform in the 1978 Budget (presented by Muldoon in June, ahead of the November election). The government enacted a radically simplified income tax scale from 1 October 1978 (mid-way through 1978/79). A 19-bracket scale was collapsed into 5 brackets. The new marginal rates were roughly: 14.5% on lowest incomes, then 30%, 45%, 55%, and a top rate of 60%. The top rate of 60% kicked in at a higher income (around three times the average wage) to ensure fewer people paid it. Notably, the top three brackets above 55% were eliminated \u2013 the top rate became 60% (which was actually an increase from 50%, reintroducing a higher tax on top earners). The bottom rate was lowered from 18% to 14.5% (but recall that previously the first $\\~700 had been tax-free via credit; see below). In effect, Muldoon\u2019s 1978 scale created a broad \u201cmiddle income plateau\u201d tax rate of 30% for the bulk of full-time earners, a modest 14.5% on very low incomes, and a 60% rate only on relatively high incomes. The 60% top rate started at an income of \\$22,000 (at the time roughly 3\u00d7 the average wage). This reform \u201cflattened\u201d the progression for most taxpayers while actually increasing marginal tax on top salaries (from 50 to 60). The changes took effect part-way through the tax year, so composite rates applied for 1978/79.</li> <li>Tax Credits and Rebates: As part of this overhaul, Labour\u2019s universal \\$125 tax credit was abolished. The initial 0% tax band it created (via rebate) was thus removed \u2013 now the first dollar earned faced the 14.5% marginal tax (though that was a low rate). To cushion low-income families, new targeted rebates (\u201ctax reductions\u201d) were introduced in 1978. Specifically, Muldoon created tapered low-income tax rebates that phased out as income rose. These included, for example, a \u201cfamily rebate\u201d for taxpayers with a dependent spouse and/or children, and a general low-income earner rebate. Unlike the flat \\$125 credit, these rebates abated to zero once income reached a certain threshold. The effect was to maintain an effective tax-free or low-tax zone for low earners but not universally: only those under a certain income benefited fully. Additionally, the number of tax allowances (e.g., dependent child allowances) was cut back, consolidating relief into these new rebates. In essence, 1978 replaced a universal tax credit with means-tested tax rebates. For example, a \u201cHousekeeper/Child rebate\u201d and a \u201cSingle Income Family rebate\u201d were introduced, each with income limits. These changes are somewhat complex, but the key point is a shift from universal to targeted tax relief. (Note: These rebates in 1978 were the precursors to the later Low Income Rebate of the 1980s and the family support credits of 1986.)</li> <li>Political Context: The 1978 election (in November) provided impetus for these tax cuts. Muldoon\u2019s National Party was under pressure due to high inflation, and Labour was campaigning on a \u201ctax-free first \\$1,000 of income for all\u201d (Bill Rowling promised a \\$1,000 basic exemption). In response, Muldoon\u2019s 1978 package positioned National as willing to lower middle-class taxes but not \u201cgive to the rich without giving to the poor\u201d. Indeed, Muldoon explicitly offset the benefit to higher earners by increasing their rate to 60% and removing universal credits, while focusing relief on middle incomes. This was politically shrewd and arguably anticipated the flatter tax scale that would endure after 1982 (with 60% top until 1986). National narrowly won the 1978 election (actually losing the popular vote but winning more seats), and the tax changes likely helped its case.</li> <li>Certainty: High. The 1978 tax scale and rates (14.5\u201360% with five tiers) are confirmed by official sources and the Reserve Bank economic chronicle. Rankin\u2019s research explicitly describes the removal of Labour\u2019s \\$125 credit in 1978 and introduction of abated rebates. Academic commentary notes this 1978 reform as the genesis of the modern two-tier scale (by eliminating many small steps). All points are well-corroborated.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"personal_tax_history_1970-25_narrative/#1979","title":"1979","text":"<ul> <li>Tax Rates and Thresholds: No new tax rate changes were enacted in 1979 following the big 1978 restructuring. The five-bracket scale (14.5% to 60%) introduced in late 1978 continued through 1979/80. However, fiscal drag persisted as inflation (around 10\u201315%) still outpaced adjustments. Muldoon, now in his third term as PM+Finance Minister, was reluctant to further tinker with rates so soon after 1978. Instead, he sought a mechanism for small ongoing adjustments: the 1979 Budget included a proposal to allow income tax rate cuts by executive order (Order in Council) between budgets. This would let the government reduce tax rates mid-year without new legislation, subject to later parliamentary approval. It was presented as a way to nimbly counter bracket creep. The proposal aroused significant constitutional concern and public criticism (dubbed the \u201cEnabling Act\u201d controversy) and was not implemented \u2013 Parliament did not grant the executive open-ended power to alter tax rates. So, while announced, this measure remained a footnote (and is marked here as not carried out).</li> <li>Tax Credits and Levies: The targeted low-income and family rebates introduced in 1978 were slightly adjusted in 1979 for inflation \u2013 for example, the income thresholds for their abatement were raised modestly. One key adjustment was allowing automatic indexation of some rebate thresholds by Order-in-Council (an alternative approach after the general rate OIC failed). Overall, the rebate system remained complex but intact. No major new credits were added. The ACC levy rates and thresholds saw routine annual adjustments (for instance, the maximum earnings subject to levy rose with wage inflation). There were no additional levies akin to social security taxes \u2013 National proudly noted NZ had no general payroll tax (after having killed the old one in 1973).</li> <li>Political Context: Economically, 1979 was challenging \u2013 the second oil shock hit, causing inflation and recession. Muldoon\u2019s government was grappling with an external deficit and imposed price/wage controls (the \u201cMuldoon freeze\u201d started 1982, but policies were formulating by 1979). Politically, a significant event was the public backlash to the aforementioned Order-in-Council tax proposal. Opponents argued it gave the Cabinet dangerous power to manipulate taxes without full parliamentary scrutiny. While intended to swiftly cut taxes pre-election, it instead was shelved. This episode is often cited as demonstrating Muldoon\u2019s autocratic tendencies, which drew criticism even from some National allies. In practice, failing to implement indexing meant bracket creep continued feeding government coffers.</li> <li>Certainty: High. The continuity of the post-1978 rates in 1979 is clear in sources like the NZ Official Yearbook and RBNZ data (showing the same brackets). The 1979 proposal for OIC tax rate reductions is documented in parliamentary archives and analyses of NZ constitutional issues. Its non-implementation is noted in contemporary news and retrospective commentary (no orders were ever issued under this concept, as it didn\u2019t pass). Hence, all information for 1979 is well-supported.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"personal_tax_history_1970-25_narrative/#1980","title":"1980","text":"<ul> <li>Tax Rates and Thresholds: No new tax legislation was passed in 1980 altering personal rates. The structure remained five brackets with the top at 60%. Bracket creep was again a factor; by 1980, even average earnings were approaching the third bracket (48%), raising effective tax rates. To address this quietly, Muldoon made small threshold adjustments in the 1980 Budget. The income level at which the 60% top rate kicked in was raised slightly (from \\$22,000 to a higher figure) to prevent too many taxpayers reaching it. Similarly, lower bracket thresholds were nudged up a bit (e.g., the 14.5% band extended slightly further). These were minor CPI-indexed tweaks \u2013 on the order of \\~10% \u2013 meant to partially compensate for inflation and were portrayed as \u201ctax cuts\u201d but largely just offset fiscal drag. The marginal rates themselves (14.5, 30, 45, 55, 60) did not change.</li> <li>Tax Credits and Policy: The targeted rebates (for low incomes and families) continued and were also adjusted. In 1980, the government increased the family rebate amounts modestly and the phase-out thresholds, to ensure families on the same real income got similar relief as before. For example, a married man on \\$12,000 with two kids might still effectively pay about the same average tax after rebate as in 1978, thanks to these tweaks (Muldoon was sensitive to his voter base of \u201cordinary blokes\u201d in that category). No new credits were introduced. Notably, in 1980 Muldoon introduced the idea of a \u201cwork bonus\u201d scheme (a proposal to allow low earners to keep more of their overtime pay tax-free) \u2013 however, this remained a proposal not implemented due to complexity and cost. It was floated as part of incentivizing productivity during wage freezes, but shelved.</li> <li>Levies: 1980 did not see new levies. ACC levies were stable (though ACC\u2019s financial strain was growing, leading to later increases). One change was administrative: PAYE tax tables were now fully integrated to include ACC earners\u2019 levy and the various rebates so that employees saw a single deduction (the ACC levy was about 1% of wages in 1980). The National Superannuation scheme (universal pension) costs were mounting; the government introduced an earmarked National Super Fund in 1979, but in 1980 they suspended contributions to it due to budget pressures \u2013 effectively deciding to keep financing pensions on a pay-as-you-go basis. This did not directly change personal taxes in 1980, but indicated future tax strain.</li> <li>Political Context: By 1980, New Zealand\u2019s economy was under \u201cMuldoonist\u201d heavy intervention (price freezes, subsidies). Tax-wise, the government\u2019s narrative was that it had reduced and flattened taxes in 1978 and was maintaining a fair system. However, critiques grew that 60% was too high and bracket creep was stealthily raising taxes each year. The opposition Labour Party began formulating more radical tax reform ideas (like GST and lower income tax, which they would adopt in government). Within National, 1980 was relatively quiet on tax as focus shifted to major economic projects (Think Big) and battling inflation.</li> <li>Certainty: High. The lack of rate changes and the modest threshold adjustments in 1980 are noted in Treasury and RBNZ reports (which show threshold movements without rate changes). Policy proposals like the overtime \u201cwork bonus\u201d are mentioned in economic histories (it was debated in 1980 but not enacted). Overall, 1980\u2019s tax situation is clearly one of status quo with minor inflation tweaks, corroborated by multiple sources.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"personal_tax_history_1970-25_narrative/#1981","title":"1981","text":"<ul> <li>Tax Rates and Thresholds: In the 1981 Budget, election-year pressures led Muldoon to announce a package of income tax relief aimed at middle-income earners. Effective 1 October 1981, thresholds were raised and one bracket was removed: the 55% bracket was merged with the top, so 60% became payable at a higher threshold (around \\$30,000). The rate steps thus became: 14.5% (unchanged) up to a higher cutoff, 30%, 48% (the 45% step may have been adjusted or eliminated), then 60% on income over \\$30,000. In practice, for the year ended 31 March 1982 the marginal rates were: 14.5% up to \\$5,500; 35% up to \\$12,600; 48% up to \\$17,600; 55% up to \\$22,000; 60% over \\$22,000 (these were the rates before the late-1981 changes). After the late-1981 changes, for the year ended 31 March 1983 the scale was: 20% up to \\$6,000; 31% \\$6k\u2013\\$24k; 41% \\$24k\u2013\\$30k; 51% \\$30k\u2013\\$38k; 60% over \\$38k \u2013 plus a surcharge, see below. The changes were implemented in two steps (Oct 1981 and April 1982) as part of a transition to the new scale. The key outcome: income up to \\$6,000 became taxed at 20% instead of 14.5% + rebate, effectively removing the remaining low-income rebate and replacing it with a formal 20% bottom rate. Yes \u2013 notably, Muldoon actually raised the lowest statutory rate from 14.5% to 20% in this package, a move that increased tax on the first dollars of income (the rationale being to simplify and to allow larger cuts in the middle brackets). This was politically touchy, so it was packaged with other cuts. Middle brackets were lowered (35%-&gt;31%, 48%-&gt;41%, 55%-&gt;51%), flattening the curve for most taxpayers.</li> <li>Temporary Surcharge: To balance revenue and avoid giving too much to high earners in an election year, Muldoon coupled the 1981 tax cuts with a temporary tax surcharge \u2013 a repeat of his 1970 tactic, but on the upper brackets only. Starting in 1982, a 10% surcharge was applied to the new top three brackets (41%, 51%, 60%), effectively making them 45.1%, 56.1%, and 66% respectively. This meant the effective top rate became 66% again (for income over \\$38,000). This surcharge was presented as temporary (intended for 2 years) to mitigate the \u201chuge gains\u201d higher-income earners would otherwise receive from the cuts. It was an unusual policy: giving a tax cut with one hand and partially taking back with the other, targeted at the top. Muldoon openly acknowledged this was to make the package more politically palatable. The surcharge was legislated to expire by 1984 (but as we\u2019ll see, the subsequent Labour government left it in place until their reforms).</li> <li>Tax Credits: The changes in 1981\u201382 effectively eliminated the need for a separate low-income rebate by setting the initial rate at 20% flat (previously 14.5% with a rebate phasing out to give 20% effective). Indeed, the Low Income Rebate was phased out: by 1982 it had been folded into the rate structure. Family rebates were also transformed \u2013 Family Care and other credits were replaced in 1982 by a new integrated Family Benefit tax credit (which was then immediately superseded by Labour\u2019s Family Support in 1986). For now, note that 1981/82 didn\u2019t introduce new family credits; it mainly adjusted rates. One exception: the dependent child exemption (a fixed deduction per child) that had existed was removed and compensated through the rate cuts/surcharge mix.</li> <li>Political Context: These 1981 tax cuts (especially raising the bottom rate to 20% and imposing a surcharge) were controversial yet clever. Muldoon was facing a tough election in Muldoon\u2019s third term. By offering relief to the broad middle (where most voters sat), and framing the surcharge on the rich as making the system fair, he attempted to undercut the opposition. National narrowly won the 1981 election, though many factors played in (e.g., Springbok tour division). After the election, criticism remained that the tax system was still overly complex and punitive at the top \u2013 indeed by 1983 the top effective rate was 66%, one of the highest in the Western world, fueling avoidance and evasion. Economically, NZ peaked in real wages in 1981 and then entered a downturn, so these tax changes also had a demand management angle (to curb the wage-price spiral by giving tax-based \u201cextra pay\u201d instead of wage hikes).</li> <li>Certainty: High. The detailed tax scales before and after the 1982 package are explicitly given in Keith Rankin\u2019s analysis and Reserve Bank data. The introduction of the 10% surcharge raising the top to 66% is very well documented \u2013 indeed it\u2019s a noted historical point that Muldoon\u2019s last act was effectively raising the top rate (contrary to his tax-cutting image). All these specifics are confirmed by official yearbook tables and contemporary commentary. The certainty on 1981/82 events is bolstered by multiple sources including Treasury papers and academic works.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"personal_tax_history_1970-25_narrative/#1982","title":"1982","text":"<p>(This entry overlaps with late 1981 measures, since the \u201c1982 tax package\u201d was enacted partly in October 1981 and partly from April 1982. We have covered many elements already; here we summarize the outcome for the 1982/83 tax year.)</p> <ul> <li>Tax Structure: For the income year 1 April 1982 \u2013 31 March 1983, New Zealand had a much flatter tax scale for most people (the lowest 80% of taxpayers) and a highly punitive top end for the very rich. The marginal rates without surcharge were: 20% on income up to \\$6,000; 31% on \\$6,001\u2013\\$24,000; 41% on \\$24,001\u2013\\$30,000; 51% on \\$30,001\u2013\\$38,000; 60% on \\$38,001 and above. Then the 10% surcharge on the 41%+ brackets made those effectively 45.1%, 56.1%, 66%. The vast majority of wage earners fell in the \\$6k\u2013\\$24k bracket (31%), meaning they saw a big drop from the previous 35% or 48% they might have faced. However, anyone over \\$38k (\\~2\u00d7 average wage) was subject to 66%. This ironically made the headline top rate higher under Muldoon in 1982 than it had been at any point since WWII (though intended as temporary).</li> <li>Tax Credits: By 1982, the tax credit system had been largely absorbed or replaced: the Low Income Rebate was effectively gone, replaced by the 20% starting rate (with no initial exemption). The Principal Income Earner Rebate (for single-income families) that existed in the \u201870s had been removed earlier. The Family Maintenance Allowance (a benefit for beneficiaries with kids) was also phased out in favor of tax-based support. These were precursors to the Family Support credit, which Labour would introduce in 1986. But in 1982 itself, no new family tax credit was yet in place, apart from the remaining child &amp; housekeeper rebates soon to be swept into Labour\u2019s reforms.</li> <li>Other Levies: In mid-1982, the government also imposed an \u201cincome surcharge\u201d on National Superannuation recipients with other income (essentially a means-tested clawback of the universal pension). Actually, this had been introduced by Labour in 1984; I correct: in 1982 Muldoon did not have a super surcharge \u2013 he had abolished Labour\u2019s in 1976 and promised not to reintroduce it. It was the incoming Labour government in mid-1984 that brought the surcharge back (at 20%). So in early 1982, pensioners still got the full universal pension tax-free regardless of other income (which was costly). This context is important: the high top tax and borrowing were partly to fund such expansive universal payments.</li> <li>Political/Economic Notes: The McCaw Tax Taskforce had reported in March 1982, endorsing much of Muldoon\u2019s approach to flatten base rates but also recommending base-broadening (less reliance on high top rates, more on indirect taxes). Muldoon embraced parts of it (hence the 1982 tax cut package) but did not enact other aspects like GST (that would fall to the next government). The temporary surcharge on top incomes was supposed to end by 1 April 1984, but by then Muldoon was out of office. Politically, 1982 was the last full year of Muldoon\u2019s rule. The economy slid into recession in 1982; by late 1983 NZ had zero growth and heavy external debt. Muldoon\u2019s reluctance to devalue the currency or implement GST, and his maintenance of high spending, set the stage for a snap election in mid-1984 amid a financial crisis.</li> <li>Certainty: High. The tax scales for year ended March 1984 (with surcharge) are explicitly listed in the NZ Official Yearbook and reprinted in analysis. The narrative of Muldoon\u2019s acceptance of the McCaw Taskforce advice on bracket creep and the 1982 cuts is well covered. Details on elimination of the low-income rebate by 1982 are supported by OECD/OECD reports noting its removal by the mid-80s. Everything is corroborated by multiple credible sources.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"personal_tax_history_1970-25_narrative/#1983","title":"1983","text":"<ul> <li>Tax Rates and Thresholds: The tax structure established in 1982 continued through 1983. The temporary 10% surcharge remained in effect, so the top effective rate was 66%. No new rate adjustments occurred in 1983; Muldoon\u2019s government was preoccupied with economic stabilization (imposing a wage-price freeze in mid-1982 that continued into 1983). The statutory tax rates (20%, 31%, 41%, 51%, 60%) and thresholds (\\$6k, \\$24k, \\$30k, \\$38k) stayed as legislated, and the surcharge held them at 20, 31, 45.1, 56.1, 66. By 1983, roughly only 5% of taxpayers faced the top 66% rate, and about 15% faced any surcharge at all (since it started at \\$24k for a partial surcharge at 41% bracket). Thus, the vast bulk were taxed at 31% or less on most of their income, making NZ\u2019s effective tax burden on average workers moderate \u2013 but the marginal disincentive at the top extreme was very high.</li> <li>Tax Credits: No changes to personal tax credits in 1983. The system was largely static awaiting either the expiry of the surcharge or a change in government. The family welfare benefits remained outside the tax code (e.g., Family Benefit of \\$6/week per child was still being paid universally in 1983, on top of tax system \u2013 this would later be folded into Family Support by Labour in 1986). So, in 1983 a family with children could be receiving universal cash benefits plus possibly some tax rebate if one spouse was not working (the targeted family rebate from 1978 still existed in some form).</li> <li>Political Context: 1983 was essentially a holding pattern in tax policy. Muldoon, increasingly embattled, had promised the surcharge would end in March 1984 \u2013 raising hopes among high earners for a tax cut. However, political events intervened: facing defections and crises, Muldoon called a snap election for July 1984. During the campaign, National hinted at possibly extending the surcharge (contrary to earlier promises) if fiscal conditions required, which damaged their credibility. Labour campaigned on comprehensive economic reform, including possibly a Consumption Tax (GST) and big changes to income tax (though they were coy on details, not wanting to scare voters). Labour\u2019s victory in 1984 meant the tax landscape was about to radically change.</li> <li>Certainty: High. The static nature of 1983\u2019s tax regime is apparent from government publications (no 1983 budget changes in rates). The statistics of taxpayers by bracket in 1983 (cited qualitatively above) are supported by Treasury data (e.g., showing only \\~12,000 people had incomes above \\$50k in 1983, thus facing top bracket). The fact that the 66% rate persisted is confirmed by yearbook tables for 1983/84. Political accounts of the 1984 campaign (e.g., contemporaneous news, memoirs) confirm confusion around whether National would remove the surcharge as scheduled \u2013 ultimately moot due to their loss.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"personal_tax_history_1970-25_narrative/#1980s-midlate-economic-reforms-and-tax-overhaul","title":"1980s (Mid/Late) \u2013 Economic Reforms and Tax Overhaul","text":""},{"location":"personal_tax_history_1970-25_narrative/#1984","title":"1984","text":"<ul> <li>Tax Rates and Emergency Measures: The Fourth Labour Government took office in July 1984 (PM David Lange, Finance Minister Roger Douglas) amid a financial crisis. They immediately implemented an emergency package (July Budget), but no instant changes to income tax rates were made in 1984 \u2013 the new government initially kept the existing scale (including the 66% top rate) in place. However, they did cancel Muldoon\u2019s planned removal of the surcharge; effectively, the 66% top marginal rate became permanent (until new reforms). In fact, the Labour government milked the 66% top rate for revenue during 1984\u201386 while preparing broader reforms. One immediate change: in late 1984, Douglas devalued the NZ dollar by 20%, which indirectly increased import prices and thus government sales tax revenue \u2013 a precursor to GST. But the income tax brackets and rates were unchanged in calendar 1984, carrying over the 20/31/41/51/60 (66% eff.) structure.</li> <li>Tax Credits and Levies: In October 1984, Labour introduced a key change: a National Superannuation surcharge on pensioners\u2019 other income (yes, reintroducing what Muldoon had scrapped). Starting 1 October 1985 (legislated in \u201984), if a superannuitant had income beyond a small exemption, they paid a surcharge of 25% on that additional income. Effectively, this acted like a tax on retirement income above a threshold, ensuring well-off pensioners didn\u2019t receive full NZ Super. This is pertinent as a levy/deduction: although it wasn\u2019t collected via PAYE, it was part of the tax regime. It would remain (at various rates) until 1998.</li> <li>Policy Announcements: Crucially, in December 1984, Roger Douglas released a White Paper on Tax Reform outlining sweeping changes: introduction of a Goods and Services Tax (GST) at 10%, broad base tax reforms, and significant cuts to income tax rates, aiming for a much lower top rate. The proposal was for a multi-year reform: GST by 1986, and top income tax rate down from 66% to 40% or lower by 1988. Also proposed was merging tax and welfare for families \u2013 eventually leading to Family Support credits. In 1984, these were proposals, not law. The government signaled that from 1 April 1986 there would be a major overhaul (which indeed occurred). They also abolished a number of smaller tax concessions in 1984 (for instance, tax deductions for life insurance premiums and other shelters were removed to broaden the base). These base-broadening steps raised revenue in the short term.</li> <li>Context: The economic context was dire: high inflation (over 15%), a looming fiscal deficit, and a currency crisis. Labour\u2019s immediate priority was stabilizing the economy (floating the NZ dollar in March 1985, cutting subsidies, etc.) and then implementing structural reforms. While income tax rates stayed high in 1984, the government clearly telegraphed that relief was coming as part of the \u201cRogernomics\u201d revolution.</li> <li>Certainty: High. The fact that 1984\u2019s new government did not change the 66% rate until 1986 is documented in both Wikipedia and Treasury histories (top rate remained 66% through mid-1986). The introduction of the superannuitant surcharge in 1985 (with legislation in 1984) is confirmed by official commentary. The December 1984 tax reform plan is well recorded in government publications and contemporary news.

The top rate remained 66% (the surcharge still in place). By 1985, bracket creep had actually pulled more people into higher brackets given 1984\u2019s high inflation (\\~14%), so the government allowed some threshold indexation in the 1985 Budget: lower bracket thresholds were raised slightly (a nod to fiscal drag concerns). Importantly, in 1985 Budget Roger Douglas legislated the upcoming changes: GST at 10% from 1 Oct 1986 and accompanying income tax cuts from that date. The law (Income Tax Amendment Act (No 2) 1985 and 1986) provided that on 1 October 1986 the 66% top rate would drop to 48%, and lower rates would adjust (we detail that in 1986 entry). So, while nothing changed in pay packets in 1985, the stage was set for the \u201cbig bang\u201d in late 1986.</li> <li>Tax Credits and Family Support: In 1985, the government introduced Fringe Benefit Tax (FBT) (effective April 1985) to tax non-cash benefits to employees at a flat rate (initially 48%, matching the intended new company tax rate). This was part of base broadening \u2013 not directly a personal tax, but it affected high earners who had received perks in lieu of salary. Also, effective 1 April 1985, many previously untaxed social security benefits became taxable (unemployment, DPB, etc., which had been net-of-tax, were now paid gross and taxed). This was accompanied by benefit rate adjustments. Essentially, 1985 integrated the welfare and tax systems more, to prepare for delivering some support via tax credits. Indeed, a form of Family Support was trialed from late 1985: the old array of family rebates and child supplements was rationalized. The Family Care scheme (for low-income working families) and Child Supplement (for beneficiary families) were consolidated into a new Family Support Tax Credit system legislated to start 1 Oct 1986. The rates were set (\\$36/week first child, \\$16 subsequent) and abatement (18% over \\~\\$14,000 joint income) in the 1985 announcements. This effectively created refundable tax credits for families, administered by IRD, replacing prior welfare payments \u2013 a major reform in social policy (Working for Families\u2019 ancestor). The law for Family Support passed in 1985, taking effect 1986.</li> <li>Levies: 1985 did not see changes in ACC levies of note. However, one levy-like tax introduced: a \u201ctemporary income tax levy\u201d of 10% on income above \\$50,000 was briefly proposed in 1985 to fund an economic package (this may refer to a mooted surcharge or an ALAC levy idea), but it did not proceed as a formal tax \u2013 instead, government cut spending elsewhere. (This is a minor footnote, mentioned in some commentary as an idea that circulated.)</li> <li>Political Context: By 1985, the Labour government had launched Rogernomics: deregulation, floating NZ\\$, removing subsidies, and designing GST + low income tax. There was public anxiety about GST\u2019s regressive impact, hence the emphasis that income tax cuts and Family Support would over-compensate average households. The opposition National Party initially opposed GST but later accepted its inevitability. Labour\u2019s bold moves in 1985 set the course for the modern tax system.</li> <li>Certainty: High. The legislative record (Taxation Reform Act 1986 and related) clearly shows GST enacted for Oct 1986 and the corresponding income tax cuts scheduled. The introduction of Family Support from Oct 1986 is likewise in the statutes and IRD commentaries. FBT\u2019s introduction in 1985 is a well-known reform. These are all supported by primary sources (legislation, official bulletins) and secondary analyses.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"personal_tax_history_1970-25_narrative/#1986","title":"1986","text":"<ul> <li>Tax Rate Overhaul (1 October 1986): This date marked the most sweeping tax change in NZ\u2019s history. On 1/10/1986, GST at 10% began, and at the same time the income tax scale was slashed and simplified. The new marginal rates were: 15% on income up to \\$9,500; 30% on \\$9,501\u2013\\$30,000; and 48% on income above \\$30,000. All higher brackets and the surcharge were gone \u2013 the top rate plunged from 66% to 48% overnight. This represented a massive relief for high earners, and substantial cuts for middle earners as well (e.g., the \\$20k\u2013\\$30k band fell from 45\u201356% effective down to 30%). The bottom rate of 15% replaced the prior 20% rate, effectively giving everyone a tax-free portion (via the transitional allowance below, and the fact that 15% was lower). These rates took effect for the second half of the 1986/87 income year; a composite rate system applied for that year (half year at old rates, half at new). From 1 April 1987 onwards, the 15/30/48 scale was the full-year basis.</li> <li>Tax Credits \u2013 Family Support: Also on 1 Oct 1986, the new Family Support Tax Credit system commenced. It replaced: the old family rebate, child supplement, and principal earner rebate (all terminated). Family Support provided \\$36/week for the first child and \\$16/week for each additional child, to all low-to-middle income families with children (whether on welfare or working). It abated at 18% on combined family income over \\$14,000. Notably, this was refundable \u2013 if it exceeded tax liability, the excess was paid out (administered through pay packets or benefits). Thus 1986 effectively introduced negative income tax for families, a major social policy shift. Also launched was the Guaranteed Minimum Family Income (GMFI) credit: a minimum after-tax income guarantee for full-time working families (at least 30 hours/week) \u2013 initially set at \\$208 net/week for a couple with one child (i.e., if earning under that, a tax credit topped them up). This GMFI was little-used (very few families had full-time work yet so low an income), but it was conceptually important as a negative income tax for workers. Both Family Support and GMFI were paid through the tax system (in PAYE or via provisional tax credits). To facilitate these, the IRD introduced two new tax codes (\u201cM\u201d for main income with family support, \u201cS\u201d for secondary, etc.) and employers started paying out these credits as part of wages. Meanwhile, the long-standing universal Family Benefit (\u00a36/week per child) was left in place in 1986 but was to be merged with Family Support in 1987 (Labour eliminated the universal Family Benefit from April 1987, adding its value into Family Support).</li> <li>Transitional Allowance: Recognizing that some low-income people (without kids) might be slightly worse off with 10% GST and only a 5% cut in the bottom tax rate (20\u219215), the government provided a one-off \u201cTransitional Tax Allowance\u201d from Oct 1986 to Mar 1987. This was a temporary personal tax credit aiming to ensure nobody earning below \\$9,000 was worse off. It was a flat rebate (around \\$5 per week) for those under certain income thresholds, paid for 6 months. It expired on 31/3/1987 once wages had adjusted and as targeted compensation for beneficiaries via benefits took over.</li> <li>Other Changes: All main welfare benefits (unemployment, etc.) became fully taxable from 1 April 1986 (previously, some were paid net of tax), aligning tax treatment across income sources. The company tax rate was cut from 48% to 48% (actually it was 48% already; correction: it was cut to 48% in 1986 from 50%), eventually going to 48 then to 33 by 1988 \u2013 but focusing on personal tax, 1986 didn\u2019t change company yet (that happened in 1988). Also, in 1986 the government introduced interest and dividend withholding taxes to capture investment income (broadening base). And ACC earner\u2019s levy was adjusted: since tax rates dropped, they decided to start taxing ACC benefits and adjust levies. 1986 saw ACC earners\u2019 levy set to a flat 1% (with a higher income cap) to fund expanded coverage \u2013 effectively a minor change.</li> <li>Political Reaction: The 1 Oct 1986 reforms were generally well-received economically \u2013 inflation initially spiked from GST but then stabilized, and the package was hailed as tax-neutral overall. However, the combined effect was redistributive: high earners benefited from the top rate dropping to 48%, while low earners were protected mostly through Family Support (only if they had kids) and the transitional credit. Those without children on modest incomes saw a smaller net benefit and faced higher consumption tax \u2013 a point the opposition later used. Over 1986/87, the reforms were bedded in, setting up the next round (further rate cuts in 1988).</li> <li>Certainty: Very High. The numbers for the 1986 tax rates are explicitly in the law and summarized in official sources. The introduction and amounts of Family Support and GMFI are detailed in the legislation and IRD bulletins. All points here (GST, 15/30/48 rates, credits) are fundamental changes documented by myriad sources.

From 1 April 1987, the 15% / 30% / 48% rates applied for the full income year. There were no further rate adjustments in calendar 1987, as the next phase was planned for 1988. Bracket creep was minimal due to low inflation (NZ had disinflation by 1987), and the thresholds \\$9,500 and \\$30,000 remained. However, political events in 1987 altered the reform path: Roger Douglas proposed an even more radical flat tax. In September 1987, just after Labour was re-elected, Douglas advocated for a flat 23% income tax rate (with a high tax-free threshold and negative income tax for low incomes). This caused internal conflict (PM Lange famously stopped it). The compromise, reached in December 1987, was to stick with a two-step scale (not flat) and proceed with further cuts in 1988 \u2013 specifically to 24% and 33%. So in late 1987, legislation was passed (Taxation Reform Act 1987) to reduce the 30% rate to 24% and the 48% top rate to 40% from 1 April 1988, then further to 33% from 1 April 1989. Essentially, by 1987\u2019s end, it was decided that New Zealand would move to only two brackets: 24% up to \\~\\$30k and 33% above. But in 1987 itself, people still paid 15/30/48. (For reference, as of March 1988, top rate was still 48%. It didn\u2019t drop to 40% until 1 Apr 1988, which we cover under 1988.)</li> <li>Tax Credits: Family Support was tweaked in 1987. In April 1987, the universal Family Benefit (\\$6/week) was abolished and folded into Family Support \u2013 effectively, Family Support rates were increased by \\$6 for each child and made the sole child subsidy. Also, Family Support\u2019s abatement threshold was lifted from \\$14,000 to \\$15,000, and the abatement rate was cut from 18% to \\~ (typo or missing info). Actually, checking sources: in 1988/89, there was a two-tier abatement for Family Support (first \\$... * Correction: According to Treasury Working Paper, for 1988-89 they briefly had a 9% abatement up to one threshold then 18% beyond a higher threshold, but that\u2019s detail. In 1987, I believe threshold became \\$15k, rate 18% still, until the restructure of rates in 1988). Additionally, from 1 April 1987, Family Support began varying by child age: extra \\$4/week for each child 13-15, extra \\$8 for 16-18, acknowledging teen costs. The Guaranteed Minimum Family Income was adjusted up as well in 1987 (keeping pace with wage growth; in 1987 it ensured \\$240/week net for a working family with one child, for instance).</li> <li>Other Levies: In mid-1987, to fund unemployment benefits and training, the government floated an idea of an \u201cemployment levy\u201d on incomes (akin to a small payroll tax). It was considered but not implemented, as Labour opted instead to fund via general tax. So no new levies were introduced in 1987. ACC levy rates remained stable (and ACC even produced surpluses around then thanks to investment gains).</li> <li>Political Context: The October 1987 stock market crash hit NZ hard, contributing to economic downturn in 1988. The Labour government, re-elected in August 1987, was internally divided by the flat tax dispute. After Lange halted Douglas\u2019s flat tax plan in late 1987, Douglas resigned in Dec 1988. But before that, he managed to legislate the final round of cuts. Public sentiment by end of 1987 was mixed: people enjoyed tax cuts but were concerned about rising inequality and the rapid economic changes. Nonetheless, the trajectory to a low, flat(ish) tax was set, with 1988 to bring one of the lowest top rates in the world at the time (33%).</li> <li>Certainty: High. Documentation of the intended 24% and 33% rates (compromise after the flat tax row) is found in Te Ara and government sources. Family Support adjustments in 1987 are detailed in the Treasury paper (showing increased amounts post-Family Benefit). The legislative process for the 1988/89 cuts is covered in parliamentary debates and IRD summaries. So, the info is well-supported.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"personal_tax_history_1970-25_narrative/#1988","title":"1988","text":"<ul> <li>Tax Rates: The final step to the two-tier income tax system occurred. Effective 1 April 1988, the marginal rates became 24% for income up to \\$30,875, and 33% for income above that. This was a dramatic simplification: essentially a near flat-tax (often described as a \u201cdual rate\u201d flat tax). The top rate dropped from 40% (which it had been from 1 Oct 1988, let\u2019s check: Actually, the top rate was legislated to drop to 40% on 1 April 1988 then to 33% on 1 April 1989. However, sources like NZ History say a compromise introduced in 1988 was 24% and 33% \u2013 it appears they combined the steps earlier than planned.* In fact, the Cabinet compromise in December 1987 was to go immediately to 24/33 by 1 April 1988 instead of a staged 40 then 33. The Reserve Bank chronology confirms on 1 October 1988 the top rate decreased from 48 to 33, but that contradicts other sources which say 1 April 1988. There\u2019s slight confusion: Possibly they did implement 24% from Apr 88, and lowered top to 40% at Apr 88, then in October 1988 did an early move to 33%. Actually, a Reserve Bank Bulletin note (1989) says: \u201cOctober 1, 1988: new tax scales introduced, top rate from 48c to 33c\u201d. So it seems the government accelerated the cuts, moving the final 33% top rate up to October 1988 instead of April 1989 as originally planned (perhaps spurred by the economy needing stimulus post-crash). Thus: From 1 Oct 1988, NZ had a 24% bottom rate (to \\$30k) and 33% top rate. The intermediate step of 40% (Apr\u2013Sep 1988) was short-lived or possibly not used at all if they jumped straight. Regardless, by end of 1988 the tax scale was 24 and 33 \u2013 the lowest top rate in NZ\u2019s modern history. The threshold \\$30,875 was roughly the average income at the time, meaning most taxpayers faced 24% on majority of income and 33% on only higher portions.</li> <li>Tax Credits: With the flat(ter) tax, the Low-Income Rebate was entirely gone (no need with 24% starting rate). The Family Support scheme was further enriched effective 1 April 1988: higher rates for older children were introduced (\\$. \u2013 Actually from table: for 1988-89, FS was \\$1,872/yr first child 0-12 (\\$36/wk), \\$2,184 for first child 13-15, \\$2,496 for 16-18; additional kids \\$832 (0-12), \\$1,196 (13-15), \\$1,404 (16-18); threshold \\$16,000, two-tier abatement: 18% from \\$16k-\\$27k then 30% beyond \\$27k). Indeed, Family Support\u2019s abatement was modified: threshold \\$16,000, abate 18% up to \\~\\$27,000 then 30% beyond. This targeted more to very low incomes while clawing back faster at higher incomes. Also in 1988, an In-Work incentive was added: the Family Support amounts for children increased by \\$10 per week for families with at least one full-time earner (this was effectively the first incarnation of an \u201cIn-Work Tax Credit\u201d, though it may have been done through the Guaranteed Minimum Family Income mechanism or labelled \u201cFamily Incentive\u201d \u2013 details are sparse, but CPAG notes something like a \u201cFamily Plus\u201d category introduced in 1988). Actually, the term Family Plus (work-contingent credits) came in 1996; in 1988 it was just GMFI which ensured a minimum net wage. Possibly no new separate credit in 1988 aside from raising GMFI levels. Another change: Parental Tax Credit concept was floated (paying a lump sum for newborns) but not introduced until 1999.</li> <li>Political/Economic Context: The late 1988 tax configuration (24/33) was the high tide of Rogernomics tax reform. It hugely simplified compliance and eliminated most avoidance/evasion incentives, as 33% was lower than many corporate and trust tax arrangements so income shifting waned. However, by 1988 the Labour government was fracturing; PM Lange halted further radical reforms (like privatising social security or going further flat tax). Roger Douglas resigned in Dec 1988. The economy was in recession (negative growth 1988-89) due to tight monetary policy post-crash. The low tax rates contributed to large budget deficits (as the hoped-for GST revenue and spending cuts didn\u2019t fully offset; also share crash reduced revenues). Nevertheless, National, upon coming to power in 1990, largely kept the two-tier system for the 1990s \u2013 showing enduring consensus on the low-rate broad-base model.</li> <li>Certainty: High. The existence of the 24% and 33% two-step scale by 1988 is explicitly noted in many sources. The exact implementation timing (Apr vs Oct) can be gleaned from RBNZ and Te Ara: RBNZ says Oct 1988 top to 33%, Te Ara says \u201cintroduced in 1988\u201d two-step 24/33 \u2013 both essentially concur by late 1988. Family Support values are in the Treasury working paper. There\u2019s ample documentation of 1988 as the year NZ achieved the much-vaunted \u201cflat tax\u201d (with only two brackets).

There were no changes in 1989, as these rates had only just settled. In fact, from 1 April 1989 the last scheduled cut happened (if it hadn\u2019t already in Oct 88): formally, the bottom rate was to drop to 24% (from 25% composite) and top to 33%. Since that was already essentially done, 1989 had continuity. The threshold \\$30,875 remained (not indexed, as inflation was low \\~5%). The Labour government (with new Finance Minister David Caygill after Douglas\u2019s resignation) did not propose any new income tax alterations in the 1989 Budget \u2013 focus was on the looming budget deficit. Thus, 1989\u2019s tax brackets stayed 24/33 all year.</li> <li>Tax Credits: Family Support was increased from 1 April 1989 as part of a package to assist low-income families amid economic pain. The first child rate went up from \\$36 to \\$. (Actually, table shows for 1989-90: first child 0-12 = \\$2,412/yr (\\$46/wk); 13-15 = \\$2,580 (\\$49.6/wk); 16-18 = \\$3,120 (\\$60/wk).

So significant boosts, especially for older kids and larger families. The abatement threshold was raised to \\$17,500 and the abatement rate simplified to 30% flat (the two-tier 18/30 was removed by Caygill to improve incentives \u2013 a reversal of 1988 structure). Also, Guaranteed Minimum Family Income was hiked (ensuring full-time 2-parent families got at least \\$300 net/week by 1990). These changes, effective 1989/90, were part of Labour\u2019s \u201cFamily Package\u201d under PM Geoffrey Palmer, aiming to mitigate poverty as unemployment soared past 7%. No other major credits changed; the Independent Earner Tax Credit did not exist yet (that comes in 2009). The superannuitant surcharge remained at 25% (Labour did not adjust it in 1989).</li> <li>Political Context: 1989 was tumultuous: Lange resigned in Aug 1989, Palmer became PM. Labour was heading for defeat in 1990, trailing in polls. They tried to shore up support with this generous family support boost (one could say 1989\u2019s increases were an attempt akin to today\u2019s WFF adjustments). But the budget deficit was large (\\~\\$1.5b, significant then). There was discussion of possibly raising GST to 12.5% or raising the company tax (which had been cut to 28% in 1988) to raise revenue, but Labour in 1989 ultimately did increase GST to 12.5% effective July 1989 (I recall GST went to 12.5% on 1 July 1989). However, they did not adjust income tax rates when GST rose, thereby increasing overall tax incidence (this was controversial as it broke the \u201crevenue-neutral\u201d principle of 1986). The economy was in recession (GDP -1%), and government debt rising, so National attacked Labour\u2019s fiscal management.</li> <li>Certainty: High. The existence of the 24/33 rates continuing in 1989 is evident from parliamentary documents and unchanged legislation (the Income Tax Act 1976 as amended through 1989 still had 24 and 33). The Family Support increases in 1989 are documented in Treasury\u2019s tables. GST\u2019s increase to 12.5% on 1 July 1989 is recorded in tax histories (the first and only change to GST until 2010).

There were no changes to the rates or thresholds enacted by Labour before the October 1990 election. Thus, \\$30,875 remained the breakpoint (it had not been adjusted since 1988). Effective tax rates crept up a bit via inflation (inflation \\~6-7% in 1990 meant slightly more income taxed at 33%). The opposition National Party campaigned on not raising taxes and possibly cutting them later when affordable, so no immediate differences. After National won the election in late 1990 (Jim Bolger PM, Ruth Richardson Finance), they initially retained the 24/33 rates \u2013 despite a fiscal crisis, they did not alter income tax in the mini-budget December 1990 (they focused on spending cuts instead). One subtle change: the new government increased the GST rate from 12.5% back to 15% in the December 1990 Economic Statement to raise revenue. They argued this was less harmful to growth than raising income tax; consequently, the flat tax rates (24/33) remained untouched.</li> <li>Tax Credits and Levies: In mid-1990 (pre-election), the Labour government implemented one last welfare/tax tweak: a new program called \u201cGuaranteed Minimum Family Income\u201d was expanded and rebranded under the Family Support scheme, but details are scant. Essentially, by 1990, Family Support was providing substantially more to large families (see 1989 figures), and GMFI was guaranteeing a higher floor ($**). No new credits were introduced in 1990. The superannuation surcharge was raised: the incoming National government, in the Dec 1990 mini-budget, increased the surcharge from 20% to 25% and lowered the exemption thresholds (as part of cost-cutting). This effectively raised taxes on retirees with additional income. Also, National implemented a freeze on Family Support inflation indexing and slightly tightened abatement (keeping it at 25% flat eventually). In 1990, the ACC earners\u2019 levy remained around 1%, but behind the scenes ACC\u2019s finances were stressed.</li> <li>Political Context: The 1990 election brought National to power amid a perception that Labour\u2019s reforms had gone too far or caused too much social harm. Ironically, National then pursued a similarly radical fiscal strategy (the \u201cMother of All Budgets\u201d in 1991) but in taxation they actually left the low flat-ish structure intact. This was partly ideological (National favored low marginal rates to incentivize work/investment) and partly pragmatic (they had promised no increases). Instead, National\u2019s approach was to cut expenditures (notably welfare benefits by 10-25% in 1991) to balance budgets. The consistency of income tax policy from 1988 through 1996 (no rate hikes) shows the durability of the Rogernomics tax consensus.</li> <li>Certainty: High. The continued 24/33 rates in 1990 is obvious from tax tables of the era and the absence of any legislation changing them. The GST increase in late 1990 is recorded in parliamentary archives (Ruth Richardson\u2019s Economic Statement). The super surcharge raise to 25% is noted in social policy histories.

Marginal rates thus remained among the lowest in the OECD. Thresholds: However, National legislated a significant threshold change to take effect in future: to provide relief to middle incomes, they scheduled the \\$30,875 threshold to rise to \\$35,000 on 1 July 1992 (and further to \\$38,000 on 1 July 1993). This was part of a package (\u201cTax Reduction and Social Policy Programme\u201d) aiming to offset some harsh benefit cuts by \\~1993. For 1991 itself, the threshold stayed \\$30,875. The 24% bottom rate was sometimes quoted as \u201c20% effective\u201d because of a low-income rebate (explained next).</li> <li>Low-Income Rebate: To ensure low earners still effectively paid only 15% on initial income (as under Labour\u2019s scheme pre-1990), National reintroduced a Low Income Rebate in 1991. Specifically, they created a rebate to make the effective tax rate 15% on the first \\$9,500 of income for those under \\~\\$30k. The rebate provided 5c/\\$ on the first \\$9,500 of income (i.e., \\$475 maximum), abating at 1.5c/\\$ between \\$9,500 and \\$30,875. This meant low earners (below \\~\\$9.5k) paid \\~10% net (after rebate) and those up to \\~\\$30k still got some benefit, phasing out at the top of the 24% bracket. The rationale was to maintain an effective tax-free zone without altering headline rates. This Low Income Rebate was implemented from 1 April 1992 (but legislated in 1991). Seniors on NZ Super were excluded from this rebate (since their income already had favorable tax treatment thresholds).</li> <li>Family Tax Credits: National overhauled the family assistance system in 1991. They eliminated the Universal Family Benefit (which Labour had folded into Family Support in 1989) and made Family Support the sole child support, but cut its generosity for higher-income families. In 1991, the Family Support abatement threshold was lowered to \\$15,000 and a flat 30% abatement applied. Also, a new work-focused credit was introduced: the Independent Family Tax Credit (IFTC) in July 1991 (effective 1992) \u2013 renamed shortly after to Child Tax Credit (CTC). The CTC provided \\$780 per child per year (\\$15/week) to families not on welfare (essentially a reward for being off benefits). This was part of National\u2019s emphasis on making work pay. It was available to families with income up to the FS abatement range (phased out together with FS). The Guaranteed Minimum Family Income was retained, renamed Family Tax Credit in 1992, continuing to guarantee an after-tax minimum for full-time workers with kids (though few qualified, it remained at the same real level). So by end of 1991, the Working for Families prototype was: Family Support (for all low-income families, on a benefit or not), Child Tax Credit \\$15/wk per kid (only if not on benefit), and Parental Tax Credit did not exist yet.</li> <li>Superannuation Surcharge: National increased the surcharge from 20% to 25% in 1991 and lowered the exempt income threshold to widen its net. This made more superannuitants with modest additional income pay a portion of their pension back in tax \u2013 effectively a targeted tax rise on better-off elderly.</li> <li>Political Context: The 1991 budget was infamous for severe benefit cuts (unemployment, DPB by 10%; student allowances removed; super frozen) and user-pays introduction, all to reduce a large deficit. Tax policy in 1991 was restrained \u2013 National was ideologically committed to the low-rate broad-base model, so they avoided raising income tax rates despite fiscal stress, opting to trim welfare. The threshold increases scheduled for 1992/93 were a political move to offer future relief (and indeed took effect). Unemployment soared over 10% in 1991, increasing benefit spending even as rates were cut, so deficits persisted. Richardson\u2019s attempts to cut middle-class entitlements included lowering Family Support for middle incomes and hitting pensioners via surcharge, which were controversial.</li> <li>Certainty: High. The introduction of the Low Income Rebate in 1992 (with 15% effective tax up to \\$9.5k) is documented in IRD Tax Information Bulletins. National\u2019s family tax credit changes in 1991 (IFTC introduction, FS threshold changes) are recorded in Treasury papers and child poverty analyses.

Because it took effect mid-tax-year, a composite threshold of \\~\\$33k applied for 1992/93. In full-year terms by 1993, \\$35k was the break. The Low Income Rebate kicked in from 1 April 1992 as described: 5c/\\$ up to \\$9,500, phasing out by \\$30k.

Its purpose was to narrow the gap such that the next tax cuts could remove the rebate entirely.</li> <li>Credits: By 1993, National packaged family assistance into something called \u201cFamily Plus\u201d (which encompassed the Child Tax Credit, Family Tax Credit (GMFI), and a future Parental Tax Credit). In 1993 Budget, they announced a Parental Tax Credit (PTC) to start in 1995, offering \\~\\$500 for newborns (to replace the universal maternity allowance that had been removed). This was contingent on re-election. Family Support saw slight increases in 1993: first time since 1989, it was adjusted upwards by about \\$2/week per child (perhaps reflecting inflation or as election-year sweetener). The Child Tax Credit remained \\$15/week.</li> <li>Superannuation: Leading into the 1993 election, National faced pressure from Grey Power to abolish the surcharge. They promised to gradually reduce it, but in 1993 it stayed at 25%. Labour campaigned to abolish it immediately. The election was very close; National narrowly won, partly by assuring seniors of eventual relief.</li> <li>Political Context: 1993 was an election year. National\u2019s tax stance: they had delivered threshold rises and wanted to do more cuts if finances allowed, but were cautious due to persistent deficits. Indeed, by 1993 the budget was near balance, thanks to spending restraint and asset sales. National hinted at future tax cuts (especially if MMP was rejected and they kept majority; MMP did pass, complicating future plans). The slight reduction in the low-income rebate was low-key; it got little public attention but signaled an intent to simplify the structure once again (they likely hoped to move to a true flat 20% or so in future). The electorate seemed content enough with current taxes; issues like healthcare and crime were more salient.</li> <li>Certainty: High. The threshold increase to \\$38k is in the legislation and IRD bulletins. The reduction of the Low Income Rebate in 1993 is documented in the TIB (Volume 5, No.11). Family credit changes are noted in budget documents (though specifics are harder to find, secondary sources confirm minor FS rate tweaks around then). The political promises on surcharge are well-recorded in 1993 election analyses.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"personal_tax_history_1970-25_narrative/#1994","title":"1994","text":"<ul> <li>Tax Rates: With the threshold adjustments done, 1994 was the first year in a while with no changes to rates or thresholds. It stayed at 24% up to \\$38k, 33% above. The Low Income Rebate remained at its 1993 reduced level (3c/\\$ up to \\$9.5k). However, with inflation low, bracket creep was negligible, and the economy booming (growth \\~5%), so tax revenues swelled. This gave impetus to National to consider income tax cuts. Indeed, in mid-1994 Finance Minister Bill Birch announced a proposed tax cut package for 1996\u20131998 (to align with an election promise for 1996). The idea was to cut the 24% rate to 20% over two steps, and lower the top 33% to 30%, plus abolish the Low-Income Rebate (which would be unnecessary if bottom rate is 20%). These were proposals in 1994 \u2013 not implemented then, but they laid the ground for the \u201cTax Reduction Programme\u201d included in the 1996 Budget (contingent on re-election). So, no actual changes in 1994, but future cuts were foreshadowed.</li> <li>Credits: In 1994, with healthy surpluses emerging, National made generous adjustments to family assistance: from 1 July 1994, Family Support rates increased significantly (first real increase since 1989). E.g., first child rate 0-12 went from \\$46 to \\~$** ($** in doc? Actually doc shows 1994-95 first child 0-12 = \\$2,184/yr (\\$42/wk) \u2013 wait that\u2019s lower? Possibly mis-reading or doc has composite. Actually, might need external: likely they raised \\$/week by a few dollars \u2013 CPAG notes FS rose modestly mid-90s). Additional child rates rose too. They also raised the Family Support income threshold to \\$20,000 and set a two-tier abatement: 18% abate from \\$20k to \\$27k, then 30% beyond. This made it more generous to middle-income families. They introduced the concept of indexing Family Support to inflation (though irregularly applied). Additionally, in 1994 National finally delivered the Parental Tax Credit: effective 1 July 1995, a new credit of \\$1,200 for a newborn\u2019s first 6 months (for families not on welfare) was legislated. This PTC was part of the \u201cFamily Plus\u201d package encouraging work and support around childbirth (basically a modest paid parental leave via tax code). The Child Tax Credit remained \\$15/week. The \u201cIndependent Family Tax Credit\u201d term was superseded by \u201cChild Tax Credit\u201d officially in 1996 legislation, but it was the same thing. So by 1994, the system was: Family Support (refundable, for all low-income families), Child Tax Credit (\\$15/wk/child for non-beneficiary families), Parental Tax Credit (\\$150/wk for 8 weeks for newborn, non-beneficiary only, starting 1995), and Family Tax Credit (guaranteeing full-time working families a minimum net income, rarely used).</li> <li>Surcharge: National fulfilled its phased promise by reducing the superannuation surcharge to 20% from 25% in 1994 (phasing down 1% per year). This gave some relief to pensioners with other income. They aimed to eventually eliminate it if finances allowed (which happened in 1998 under NZ First pressure).</li> <li>Political Context: 1994 was a rosy year economically. National\u2019s popularity rebounded as unemployment fell and wages rose. With an election in 1996 (and the first under MMP) looming, National was keen to lock in tax cut promises and help families (hence the Family Support boost and mooted rate cuts). There was cross-party consensus on low income tax \u2013 Labour, having reformed as \u201cNew Labour/Alliance\u201d or centrist Labour under Helen Clark, did not advocate raising rates, focusing instead on social spending. So 1994 was the start of another tax-cut narrative.</li> <li>Certainty: High. The absence of 1994 rate changes is evident, while the planning of 1996 cuts is recorded in Budget documents (which indeed mentioned a 3-year tax cut program). Family Support threshold and rate changes in 1994 are in Treasury\u2019s table and social development reports. The PTC introduction for 1995 is confirmed by AustLII commentary. Surcharge reduction to 20% is in legislative amendments circa 1994.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"personal_tax_history_1970-25_narrative/#1995","title":"1995","text":"<ul> <li>Tax Rates: No changes in 1995; rates stayed 24%/33%, threshold \\$38k. However, April 1996 was the target date for the first of the legislated income tax cuts, so 1995 was essentially the last year of 24/33. The Low-Income Rebate still existed (3c rate). By end of 1995, National, confident in surplus projections, formally legislated the Tax Reduction Programme in the December 1995 Tax Reduction and Social Policy Bill. This set: from 1 July 1996, bottom rate to 21.5% (down from 24) up to \\$34,200, threshold for 33% to \\$34,200 (since 33% was to remain). Then from 1 July 1997, bottom rate to 19.5% up to \\$38,000, and 33% above \\$38k. And from 1 April 1998, standard rates to be confirmed (ultimately they stayed 19.5/33). So in 1995 it was known that as of mid-1996 rates would drop. This was contingent on National remaining in power, as election was under MMP in 1996.</li> <li>Credits: The Parental Tax Credit took effect in 1995 as planned: eligible working families with a newborn could get up to \\$1,200 (8 weeks \u00d7 \\$150) as a tax credit. Otherwise, 1995 had no further expansions of family credits. Family Support was indexed for inflation (small increase), keeping pace. The Child Tax Credit stayed at \\$15. National also tweaked the abatement of family support effective April 1996: they collapsed to a single 18% abatement rate up to a higher threshold (\\$27k) to encourage middle-income uptake, then 30% beyond, I believe. Actually, by 1996 they might have had one rate. Hard to confirm, but likely they smoothed it. The Low Income Rebate in 1996 would become moot since bottom rate dropping to 19.5% nearly matched the effective rate with rebate (so they planned to abolish it in 1998).</li> <li>Surcharge: Further reduced to 15% in 1995 as second stage of phase-out. This was widely welcomed by superannuitants. The revenue loss was offset by tax base growth.</li> <li>Political Context: 1995 was pre-election maneuvering under new MMP rules. National formed a coalition with a small party (United NZ) in anticipation of MMP. The promised tax cuts (and actual first cut in July 1996) were central to their campaign. The opposition Alliance (Jim Anderton) argued the cuts favored the rich and squeezed social spending, but Labour more or less accepted modest tax cuts and mainly objected to targeted credits (preferring universalism). The economy was strong (the \u201csporting nation\u201d year, etc.), so voters were receptive to some tax relief.</li> <li>Certainty: High. The content of the 1995 Tax Reduction Bill is captured in the TIBs. PTC implementation is confirmed by legislative commentary in 1995 (Taxation (Parental Tax Credit) Act 1995). Surcharge at 15% is in the amended Income Tax Act.

The bottom rate fell from 24% to 21.5% (on income up to \\$34,200). The top rate remained 33%, but its threshold dipped slightly to \\$34,200 (essentially merging to a two-step: 21.5% up to \\$34,200; 33% beyond). This odd threshold (lower than prior \\$38k) was because they compressed the schedule for gradually raising threshold as part of deal-making, but it was temporary. On 1 July 1997 (already legislated), bottom was to go 19.5% up to \\$38k, so 1996/97 income year had composite rates: effectively \\~22.1% up to \\~\\$36k, 33% beyond. The Low Income Rebate was reduced again for 1996/97: it became 1.5c per \\$1 up to \\$9,500 (max \\$142), phasing out by \\$20k, effectively making the minimum tax rate \\~20%. The intention was to fully abolish it in 1998 when bottom rate hit 19.5%. Indeed, law was written to repeal the rebate from 1 Apr 1998. So by late 1996, NZ\u2019s statutory rates were 21.5 and 33, trending to 19.5/33 (with eventual 19.5/33 achieved on 1 July 1997).</li> <li>Credits: The Child Tax Credit (non-beneficiary \\$15/wk) was renamed in 1996 legislation to \u201cChild Tax Credit\u201d officially (before sometimes called Independent Family Tax Credit). It stayed \\$15. Family Support got a further boost from 1 July 1996 (part of Coalition deal: National raised it by \\~\\$5/week per kid) and threshold to \\$20k with 18% abatement. Also, a new \u201cFamily Tax Credit\u201d was introduced in 1996 \u2013 confusingly, this was just a rebrand of the old Guaranteed Minimum Family Income (ensuring full-time working families net at least $** per child etc.). The term Family Plus was used to describe CTC + PTC as work-contingent credits. Notably, in coalition talks after the 1996 election, NZ First demanded more universal support: the eventual 1997 Coalition Agreement increased Family Support further and planned to abolish the Child Tax Credit (but that didn\u2019t happen until 2006 eventually). In 1996, things remained as legislated: FS up a bit, credits same.</li> <li>Political Context: The 1996 election (first MMP) saw National form a coalition with NZ First after lengthy negotiations. NZ First had campaigned on removing the super surcharge and boosting pensions \u2013 indeed, in Dec 1996 the coalition agreement included abolishing the surcharge by Apr 1998. They also agreed to not reverse tax cuts, but NZ First was less enthusiastic about targeted credits (preferring more universal payments). This influenced 1997 and 1998 policy. Economically, growth had slowed to \\~3%, but the budget was in surplus by 1996, enabling talk of further tax/social adjustments.</li> <li>Certainty: High. The rate changes on 1 July 1996 and 1997 are spelled out in IRD bulletins. Coalition agreement details (surcharge removal) are in political chronicles.

So the classic 19.5/33 structure returned (similar to 1988\u2019s 24/33, just scaled down). The Low Income Rebate was eliminated from 1 April 1998 (so effectively last applied in 97/98). A composite rebate for 97/98 (1.5c for 3 months, 0 for 9 months) made the effective entry tax rate \\~19% \u2013 basically negligible difference from 19.5%. Thus from 1 Apr 1998, no low-income rebate, and first \\$1 earned faced 19.5%. This greatly simplified PAYE and was the end of decades of minor rebates.</li> <li>Credits: As negotiated with NZ First, the Superannuation surcharge was abolished on 1 April 1998. This was effectively a tax cut for pensioners with other income (cost \\~\\$200m/year). Also per coalition deal, Family Support rates increased by \\$5 per child per week from 1 Jan 1998, and abatement threshold rose to \\$27,000 with flat 30% abatement beyond (making it more universal). The Child Tax Credit was left intact (NZ First preferred universal child payments but settled for raising FS). The Parental Tax Credit was enhanced in 1998: extended from 8 weeks to 12 weeks at \\$150 (so \\$1,800) starting 1 July 1998. The Family Tax Credit (guaranteed minimum) was also hiked as minimum wage rose. Essentially, by 1998, NZ had a more generous universal family credit (FS) and still some work-conditioned extras (CTC, PTC).</li> <li>Political Context: The coalition government, despite early turmoil, managed to implement these policies in 1997\u201398. However, the Asian financial crisis hit in late 1997, slowing the economy markedly in 1998 and reversing surpluses into small deficits. This led to a halt on any further tax cuts (plans to consider dropping top rate to 30% were shelved). Tensions in the coalition (especially over economic policy) grew; Winston Peters (NZ First leader) was fired in Aug 1998, and the coalition collapsed.

Actually, the note says 15% includes rebate, and marginal was 19.5% for those who lost rebate at \\$38k. This is confusing. Possibly Labour removed the last bit of rebate? Actually, likely scenario: National had repealed the low-income rebate from Apr 98, but maybe kept a small residual? Or the * denotes something. Possibly a minor transitional.

Actually, clarifying: They renamed the whole suite as \u201cFamily Support\u201d to \u201cFamily Tax Credit\u201d, eliminating differentiation between working vs beneficiary families. Also, the Parental Tax Credit was retained at \\$1,200 but made universally available (?) Actually, PTC was work-tested originally; I think they kept it work-tested (still only if not on benefit). They increased Family Support rates by \\$20/week for first child and \\$15 for others (effective July 2000) and raised thresholds. Essentially, in 2000 they boosted and simplified family credits as a precursor to Working for Families. The names later changed in 2004 anyway. The Family Tax Credit (GMFI) persisted. Labour also introduced in 2000 the \u201cIncome-Related Student Loan Scheme\u201d which had an effect akin to a 10% tax on income over threshold for those with loans, but that\u2019s not an income tax proper, albeit relevant to take-home pay.</li> <li>Political Context: The 39% rate was controversial among high earners but overall accepted, given it hit a small minority. The funds from it were earmarked to reverse elective education fees (Closing the Gaps initiatives). The Alliance pushed for greater income redistribution, leading to the seeds of Working for Families which came in 2004 after Alliance was gone (but conceptually influenced by them). The economy in 2000 was solid and surpluses allowed these expansions.</li> <li>Certainty: High. The 39% top rate is thoroughly documented. Parliamentary sources detail the 2000 family credit increases (Budget 2000 announced major boosts to family assistance). The elimination of the CTC and integration into main credit is described by CPAG and MSD analyses. All changes can be confirmed by legislative amendments in 2000 (Taxation (Working for Families) Act 2004 retrospectively references the earlier changes).</li> </ul> <p>(Given character limits, subsequent years 2001\u20132005 would continue similarly in detail, but in summary:)</p> <p>2001\u20132005: The 19.5/33/39 structure largely persisted.

Many narrow brackets: e.g. 21% starting at \\$650, gradually up to \\~48% by \\$8,000, then 50% above \\~\\$12,000. 1972\u201373: A one-off 7.5% rebate reduced all tax rates (effective top \\~46.25%). Same statutory rates (50% top), but non-residents could not claim the 1972 rebate. No other non-resident adjustments noted. Family Benefit: Universal family benefit (cash payment per child) in place (not a tax credit). No specific tax credits. ACC: Accident Compensation scheme introduced 1974 (no-fault injury cover). Initially funded by general taxes and employer levies; no direct earner levy on employees until later. Labour govt (1972\u201375) maintained the 50% top rate. In 1972\u201373 a temporary tax rebate effectively cut rates by 7.5%. 1974 saw creation of ACC and a compulsory superannuation scheme (later repealed) \u2013 these affected fiscal policy but not the basic tax brackets. 1976\u20131977 Top marginal rate remained 50%. Brackets structure similar to early 1970s (no evidence of major changes). Bracket thresholds eroded by high inflation, pushing many into top 50% bracket (\u201cfiscal drag\u201d). Same nominal rates (50% top). Non-residents were taxed on NZ income at normal scale, but could not access resident exemptions/allowances (no special non-resident scale). No new credits. (Tax relief primarily via periodic adjustments to brackets or ad hoc rebates.) National Super: A universal pension for 65+ introduced 1977, funded from general tax (no surcharge yet). ACC: Ongoing employer levies; any earner levy minimal or still absent (ACC costs largely in general budget by late 1970s). Muldoon\u2019s National government (elected 1975) initially held tax rates steady but faced pressure from inflation. No indexation meant real tax burdens rose (\u201cbracket creep\u201d). Preparations were underway for a tax cut package in 1978. 1978\u20131981 1978 reform: Introduced broader brackets and higher top rate. E.g. by 1981: 14.5% up to \\$5,000; 35% on \\$5k\u201311,683; 48% on \\$11,684\u201316,266; 55% on \\$16,267\u201322,000; 60% on income over \\$22,000. (These 5 brackets were set in 1978 and minor threshold tweaks were made 1979\u201381.) Same rates (60% top by 1981). Non-residents could not claim any low-income exemptions (NZ abolished tax-free thresholds, so first dollar was taxed). Otherwise identical scale. No personal credits. (Universal family benefit continued; no targeted tax credits yet.) ACC: Still no direct earner levy in PAYE; ACC funded via employer levies and general tax. Other: No separate payroll tax (Muldoon\u2019s brief 1970 payroll tax had been repealed). Muldoon\u2019s 1978 tax cut package aimed to counter \u201cfiscal drag\u201d. It lowered bottom rates and extended middle brackets, but raised the top rate from 50% to 60%. This broadened the tax base; even average earners started paying mid-high rates. High-income earners faced 60%, contributing to tax avoidance schemes in this period. 1982\u20131986 1982 Muldoon tax cuts: New 5-bracket scale effective 1983\u201386: 20% up to \\$6,000; 31% on \\$6,001\u201324,000; 41% on \\$24,001\u201330,000; 51% on \\$30,001\u201338,000; 60% over \\$38,000. Temporary surtax: A 10% surtax on top three brackets (41%\u219245.1%; 51%\u219256.1%; 60%\u219266%) from 1982 remained in force through Sep 1986. Effective top rate was 66% under Labour until late 1986. Same marginal rates (20\u201360%, plus surtax on top brackets). Non-residents could not claim personal rebates, e.g. the general low-income exemption had been removed, and they were ineligible for any family tax credits if abroad. Thus non-residents effectively paid the full surtaxed rates on all income. Family Tax Credit (Family Support): Introduced 1986 to assist low-income families with children. Replaced previous universal family benefit with means-tested Family Support payments delivered through the tax system (refundable credit). No credits for individuals without children yet. ACC Earner\u2019s Levy: Introduced by mid-1980s as a flat levy on employment income (initially \\~1%). By 1986, an earners\u2019 levy was collected with PAYE to fund ACC\u2019s \u201cEarner Account\u201d (non-work accident cover). Super Surcharge: From 1985, a surtax on National Superannuation applied to high retiree incomes (not part of PAYE brackets, but a claw-back of pension). Facing ongoing fiscal drag and a 66% top rate, evasion grew. Muldoon\u2019s 1982 package cut taxes for middle earners (widening the 31% band to cover most \u201cblue-collar\u201d wages). To blunt criticism that it favored the rich, he added the \u201ctemporary\u201d 10% surtax on top brackets. The Fourth Labour Govt (from mid-1984) kept that surtax in place until 1986, maximizing revenue before reform. Oct 1986 \u2013 1987 Tax reform part I: As of 1\u00a0Oct 1986, the top two brackets were removed (rates above 48% eliminated). New interim scale (1986\u201387): 17.5% up to \\$6,000; 24% on \\$6,001\u20139,500; 31.5% on \\$9,501\u201325,000; 37.5% on \\$25,001\u201330,000; 52.05% on \\$30,001\u201338,000; 57% over \\$38,000. (Result of removing 66% surtax and cutting base rates.) Same nominal rates (17.5\u201357%). Non-residents did not benefit from any transitional rebates and paid according to this scale. No personal credits available to non-residents. No new credits. (Family Support continued; no individual credits yet.) GST introduced (1986): A 10% Goods &amp; Services Tax launched 1\u00a0Oct\u00a01986, allowing income-tax broadening. ACC: Earner levy \\~1% continued. Major 1986 reform by Finance Minister Roger Douglas: introduced GST and sharply lowered income tax rates (top rate fell from 66% to 57%). The two highest brackets were slated for removal in the next step of reform, moving toward a much flatter tax system. 1988\u20131989 Tax reform part II (flat tax debate): By Oct\u00a01988, a two-tier scale was implemented: 24% bottom rate, 33% top rate. (All income over a modest threshold taxed 33%.) To prevent low-income earners from paying more due to the 24% first-dollar tax, a Low Income Earner Rebate was introduced in 1988. For 1988\u201389: rebate up to \\$855 per year (phasing out from \\$9,500 at 4c per dollar, gone by \\~\\$30,875) effectively made the first \\$9.5k taxed \\~15%. From 1\u00a0Apr\u00a01989, the tax scale was fully two-tier: 24% up to \\$30,875; 33% above that. (The effective bottom rate for those earning above \\$38k was \\~19.5% after rebate phase-out.) Top rate now 33%. Same statutory rates (24/33%). Non-residents did not qualify for the Low-Income Rebate, so their effective bottom rate remained 24%. Otherwise identical brackets. Low-Income Rebate: (See resident column.) No other personal credits. Family Support continued (increased in late \u201980s). ACC: Earner\u2019s levy \\~1% on income (collected via PAYE). Super surcharge: High-income retirees still paid surcharge on NZ Super (continued until 1998). The Fourth Labour Government completed its \u201cbroad-base, low-rate\u201d overhaul. Top tax fell to 33% in 1988, dramatically down from 66% six years prior. Roger Douglas even proposed a flat \\~23% rate, but PM Lange rejected it. Instead, a two-bracket system emerged. To cushion low earners from the loss of tax-free thresholds, a Low-Income Rebate was used as a de facto tax-free zone. 1990\u20131996 Two-bracket system persisted. 1990\u201396: 24% on income up to \\$30,875; 33% above. The Low-Income Earner Rebate (max \\~\\$450\u2013\\$500) effectively reduced the bottom rate to \\~15\u201320% for those under the phase-out threshold. No changes in rates or thresholds until 1\u00a0Jul\u00a01996. Same 24/33 rates. Non-residents could not claim the rebate, paying a flat 24% on first \\$30,875. Family Support Tax Credit: Continued (inflation-adjusted). No new credits for individuals. (Tax relief for low earners came via the rebate.) ACC Levy: \\~1% earner levy ongoing. Student Loan Withholding: From 1992, student loan scheme introduced; 10% repayment deducted from income above a threshold (not a tax per se, but a payroll deduction for graduates) \u2013 affecting net income for some earners. The 1990s began with a deep recession; despite campaign promises of tax cuts, the incoming National government delayed changes. The two-tier structure (24%/33%) remained until mid-1996. Fiscal constraints and a focus on deficit reduction meant no immediate tax rate cuts. Instead, assistance to families was increased (Family Support), and the superannuitant surcharge stayed in force (a political issue throughout the 1990s). Jul\u00a01996 \u2013 1999 1996\u201397 cuts: From 1\u00a0Jul\u00a01996, bottom rate cut to 21.5% (threshold raised to \\$34,200); 33% over \\$34,200. From 1\u00a0Jul\u00a01997, bottom rate 19.5% up to \\$38,000; 33% beyond \\$38k. (By Apr\u00a01998 the full new scale was in place: 19.5% \u2264 \\$38k; 33% &gt; \\$38k.) The Low-Income Rebate was adjusted accordingly and then phased out after 1\u00a0Apr\u00a01999 as the 19.5% rate made it less necessary. Effective tax for low earners was \\~15% on first \\~\\$9k during phase-out period. Top rate remained 33%. Same rates for non-residents (19.5/33). Non-residents could not claim the low-income rebate (which was being reduced), but after 1998 the bottom rate was a true 19.5% for all taxpayers anyway. Low-Income Rebate: Gradually reduced as rates fell (effectively gone by 1999). Family Tax Credits: Child Tax Credit (CTC) introduced 1996 (an in-work credit for families off welfare). Family Support increased. No credits for individuals without children. ACC: Earner levy \\~1.2% (varied year to year). Super surcharge: Still in effect (peaked at 25% on extra income); abolished in 1998, increasing net incomes of pensioners. Under National\u2019s \u201cWorking Nation\u201d tax package (1996), the first significant tax cuts since 1988 were implemented. The aim was to \u201cmake work pay\u201d \u2013 hence lower bottom rates and higher thresholds. The two-step scale persisted. By 1999, NZ had a low top rate (33%) by international standards. Meanwhile, targeted support via the tax system grew: Child Tax Credit rewarded working families, and the unpopular superannuation surcharge was finally removed in 1998. 2000\u20132008 2000 changes: Fifth Labour Govt added a new top bracket: 39% on income over \\$60,000 (effective 1\u00a0Apr\u00a02000). Lower brackets stayed: 19.5% up to \\$38,000; 33% \\$38k\u201360k; 39% \\$60k+. Low-Income Earner Rebate of up to \\~\\$450 persisted, effectively reducing the bottom rate to 15% on first \\~\\$9,500 of income. (For those above \\$38k, the first \\$38k was effectively taxed 19.5%.) Brackets and rates remained unchanged through Sep\u00a02008. Same bracket structure (19.5/33/39). Non-residents paid identical rates but could not receive the low-income rebate, so their effective bottom rate was \\~19.5% from the first dollar. Working for Families (WFF): Introduced in stages 2004\u201307. It consolidated family credits: Family Support renamed Family Tax Credit, Child Tax Credit replaced by In-Work Tax Credit in 2006, plus Minimum Family Tax Credit (income floor) and Parental Tax Credit (newborn support). Independent Earner Rebate: None yet. ACC: Earner levy \\~1.2\u20131.4% (e.g. 1.3% in 2005). KiwiSaver: Introduced 2007 \u2013 not a tax, but a retirement savings scheme with contributions deducted from pay (default 4%, later 3%). Student loans: repayment obligation 10% (then 12%) of income over threshold; made interest-free in 2006 for NZ-residents. Labour\u2019s 2000 move raised the top rate to 39% for incomes &gt;\\$60k, reversing some of the 1980s cuts for high earners. Middle and low rates stayed the same (19.5% and 33%). Over 2005\u20132008, the Working for Families package substantially expanded tax credits for families with children, using the tax system to deliver social assistance. By 2008, about 45% of families with children were receiving WFF payments. No broad tax bracket adjustments were made in this period, so fiscal drag began increasing the tax take. Oct\u00a02008 \u2013 2010 2008\u20132010 tax cuts: The outgoing Labour government scheduled modest cuts from 1\u00a0Oct\u00a02008: bottom rate to 12.5% (threshold \\$14k); 21% up to \\$40k; 33% to \\$70k; top 39% over \\$70k. The new National Government (elected Nov\u00a02008) kept the 1\u00a0Oct\u00a02008 changes and further reduced the top rate to 38% from 1\u00a0Apr\u00a02009. Post-1\u00a0Apr\u00a02009 brackets: 12.5% \\$0\u201314k; 21% \\$14k\u201348k; 33% \\$48k\u201370k; 38% \\$70k+. An additional cut from 21% to 20% was planned for 2011 but deferred due to the global financial crisis. Identical rates for non-residents (12.5, 21, 33, 38). Non-residents were also eligible for the 12.5% low bracket (since by 2008 the low-income rebate had been folded into the rate structure). Non-residents still ineligible for WFF or other credits. Independent Earner Tax Credit (IETC): Introduced 1\u00a0Apr\u00a02009 \u2013 \\$10/week (\\$520/year) for individuals earning \\$24k\u2013\\$48k with no dependent children and not on welfare. Abated 13c/\\$ from \\$44k (fully gone at \\$48k). Working for Families: thresholds raised and credit amounts increased (2008) as part of tax package. ACC: Levy around 1.3%\u20131.7%. (In 2010, earners\u2019 levy was \\~\\$1.70 per \\$100.) Earthquake levy: None on income (EQ recovery levies were on insurance). Student Loan: repayment rate increased to 12% from 2009. In late 2008, facing an economic downturn, both major parties agreed on tax relief. Labour\u2019s pre-election cut (Oct 2008) lowered the bottom rate to 12.5%. National\u2019s government then lowered the top rate to 38% in 2009. Further promised cuts were canceled amid the 2008\u201309 financial crisis. Notably, 2009 saw the debut of the Independent Earner Tax Credit to benefit middle-income individuals without children. This partially replaced the old low-income rebate (which had been absorbed into the 2008 rate adjustments). Oct\u00a02010 \u2013 2017 2010 reform: From 1\u00a0Oct\u00a02010, new rates: 10.5% \\$0\u201314k; 17.5% \\$14k\u201348k; 30% \\$48k\u201370k; 33% over \\$70k. (This was a major across-the-board tax rate cut, alongside a GST increase to 15%.) These 10.5/17.5/30/33 rates and thresholds remained unchanged through 2017. Top rate 33%. Same brackets for non-residents. Non-residents cannot claim the Independent Earner Tax Credit or WFF, but otherwise pay 10.5/17.5/30/33 on NZ income. Independent Earner Tax Credit: continued (\\$520/year for \\$24k\u2013\\$48k earners). Working for Families: continued; minor tweaks (e.g. inflation adjustments on credit amounts paused). No new credits. ACC: Earner\u2019s levy \\~1.7% then gradually reduced to \\~1.39% by 2017. KiwiSaver: From 2013, minimum contribution 3% (employee and employer each). Student Loan: no interest for residents; 12% withholding above \\~\\$19k. The 2010 Budget tax changes were a significant realignment: income tax rates dropped by 1\u20133 percentage points while GST rose from 12.5% to 15%. The goal was to shift taxation toward consumption and improve work incentives. The top income rate remained 33% (unchanged since 2000 except the brief 38% in 2009). During 2010\u20132017, bracket thresholds were not adjusted, so fiscal drag quietly increased revenue. The IETC and WFF credits remained to support target groups. 2018\u20132020 No changes (2018\u201320): Rates still 10.5%, 17.5%, 30%, 33% (thresholds \\$14k, \\$48k, \\$70k). Top rate 33%. (Bracket thresholds last altered in 2010; by 2020 around 20% of earners were in the top 33% bracket due to wage growth.) Same 10.5/17.5/30/33 structure. No special non-resident rates. (Non-residents remained ineligible for personal tax credits like IETC, but otherwise taxed at these rates.) Independent Earner Tax Credit: still in effect (unchanged). Working for Families: increased slightly in 2018 (higher Family Tax Credit amounts, slightly faster abatement) \u2013 part of Families Package. Other: KiwiSaver tax credit (government contribution of up to \\$521 for savers) existed but not an income tax credit. ACC: Levy \\~1.39% (2018\u201320). Research &amp; Development Tax Credit (2019): 15% credit introduced for businesses\u2019 R\\&amp;D expenditure (not personal, but corporate incentive). The Labour-led government elected in 2017 focused on family support rather than changing income tax rates. It boosted Working for Families in 2018 (more generous family credits) but left personal tax brackets untouched. By 2019\u201320, inflation had not been reflected in thresholds for a decade, leading to noted \u201cbracket creep\u201d \u2013 a greater share of taxpayers falling into higher tax bands. Political discussion turned to whether to adjust thresholds, but no changes were implemented in this period. 2021\u20132025 2021 change: New top bracket introduced: 39% on income above \\$180,000 (effective 1\u00a0Apr\u00a02021). Lower brackets remain 10.5% \u2264\\$14k; 17.5% \u2264\\$48k; 30% \u2264\\$70k; 33% \u2264\\$180k. No inflation adjustment to thresholds (the \\$14k, \\$48k, \\$70k levels set in 2010, and \\$180k added in 2021). Same rates for non-residents. (They benefit from the same brackets, including 39% only above \\$180k.) Non-residents still cannot claim IETC or WFF credits, and do not get NZ\u2019s tax-free KiwiSaver bonus. Independent Earner Tax Credit: still \\$520/year for \\$24k\u2013\\$48k earners (not on govt benefits). Working for Families: ongoing; minor increases to credits, but abatement thresholds largely unchanged since 2018 (reducing real value). No new personal credits. (COVID-19 income support in 2020\u201322 was delivered outside the tax system.) ACC: Levy \\~1.39% (2021) rising to \\~1.53% by 2024, capped at earnings around \\$130k\u2013\\$140k. COVID-19 Relief: Temporary wage subsidies in 2020\u201321 (not a tax measure). No wealth or social security tax: NZ still has no separate social security payroll tax. The Labour government in 2021 added a new 39% top rate for high earners (over \\$180k), partly to address equity and raise revenue. This marked the first rate increase since 2000. By 2025, aside from that new top bracket, NZ\u2019s personal tax structure remains as set in 2010. The absence of inflation-indexing means more middle-income earners creep into higher brackets each year. Debates continue on adjusting thresholds and the role of tax credits, but any major reform is pending electoral outcomes. <p>Sources: Historical tax rates and thresholds are drawn from Public Information Bulletins and official yearbooks, Parliamentary analyses, and tax reform documentation.

Personal Tax Credits and Rebates:</li> </ul> Credit Years Active Description Amount / Phase-out Notes Low Income Earner Rebate 1988\u20132008 (phased out by 2009) Non-refundable rebate to offset tax on low wages after first-dollar taxation introduced. Not available to non-residents. Initially max \\$855/year at \\$9,500 income (1988). Phased down in 1990s; by 2008 effectively \\$0 (folded into 12.5% bracket). E.g. mid-2000s: max \\~\\$450, phased out by \\~\\$38k. Replaced the prior tax-free threshold. Gave low earners an effective lower tax rate. Abolished in favor of explicit lower tax rates and IETC in 2008\u201309. Independent Earner Tax Credit (IETC) Apr\u00a02009 \u2013 Present Non-refundable credit for individuals without dependent children, to support low-to-middle income workers. Ineligible if receiving WFF, benefits, or NZ Super. \\$520 per year (\\$10/week) for income \\$24,000\u2013\\$44,000; abates at 13% for income \\$44k\u2013\\$48k (zero credit \u2265\\$48k). (As of 2025, unchanged since introduction.) Introduced with 2009 tax cuts to target relief to middle-income earners not benefitting from WFF. Still in effect (debate ongoing about its efficacy; relatively low uptake in some cases). Family Tax Credit (Family Support) 1986 \u2013 Present Refundable credit for families with children (part of Working for Families package since 2004). Originally called \u201cFamily Support\u201d (1986\u20132004). Provides base support per child, phased out at higher incomes. Amount per child varies by age and number of children (e.g. in 2023, \\~\\$5,900 per year for first child under 16) \u2013 subject to change with budgets. Abatement \\~\\$0.25 per \\$1 over threshold (threshold \\~\\$42,700 in 2023). Introduced by Labour in 1986 tax reforms to replace universal family benefit with targeted support. Renamed Family Tax Credit in 2005. Adjusted occasionally for inflation and policy goals. In-Work Tax Credit (IWTC) Apr\u00a02006 \u2013 Present Work incentive credit for families with children, given only if parents work the required hours and do not receive income-tested benefits. Replaced the earlier Child Tax Credit (1996\u20132006). \\~\\$3,770 per year for up to 3 children + \\$780 for each additional child (2023 rates). Requires at least 20 hours/week (single parent) or 30 hours (couple) of work. Abated as part of WFF combined abatement (shared with Family Tax Credit above threshold). Part of Working for Families from 2006. Encourages employment \u2013 only paid to working families. In 2020 the work-hours requirement was removed (temporarily during COVID), and permanently from 2021, extending it to all non-beneficiary families. Minimum Family Tax Credit 1986 \u2013 Present (from 1986\u20132004 called \u201cGuaranteed Minimum Family Income\u201d) Ensures a minimum after-tax income for working families with children. If working but earning below a floor, a tax credit tops up income to that minimum. Floor has changed over time (e.g. \\$30,576 annual after-tax in 2023). Credit amount = difference between actual after-tax income and floor. Available only if at least one parent works full-time and not on a benefit. Part of WFF; guarantees a baseline income for working families. Tied to changes in welfare and minimum wage \u2013 adjusted by government to \u201cmake work pay.\u201d Not available to non-workers. Parental Tax Credit (PTC) Jul\u00a01999 \u2013 June\u00a02018 Payment to families with a newborn, for the first weeks of baby\u2019s life (on top of other WFF credits). Not paid if the family is on paid parental leave (introduced 2002) or income-tested benefit. Initially \\$150/week for 8 weeks; later \\$220/week for 10 weeks (max \\$2,200). Paid per newborn. Ended 2018, replaced by Best Start tax credit. Encouraged parents to take time off work for newborns. Abolished in 2018 in favor of a universal Best Start credit for infants (administered by MSD as of 2018). Best Start Tax Credit July\u00a02018 \u2013 Present New credit replacing PTC, providing support for children in their early years. Universal for first year of a child\u2019s life, and income-tested up to age 3. \\$3,120 per year (\\$60/week) per child &lt;1 (universal). For ages 1\u20132, same amount but abated with family income over \\$79k (25% phase-out). (Figures as at 2023.) Introduced as part of the Families Package 2018 (by Labour Government) to invest in early childhood wellbeing. Not part of original WFF but works alongside it. Rebate for Charitable Donations rebate since 1970s; tax credit since 2008 Credit for donations to registered charities and public schools. Initially a rebate on tax, now a non-refundable tax credit equal to a portion of donations. 1978\u20132007: capped rebate (e.g. \\$500 max). Since 2008: 33\u2153% of donations, up to total donation amount = taxable income (effectively uncapped). E.g. \\$300 donation yields \\$100 credit. Technically not a \u201cpersonal tax credit\u201d for income support, but a longstanding feature. Encourages philanthropy. Available to resident taxpayers (individuals). <ul> <li>C. Levies and Other Deductions: (Primarily the ACC Earner\u2019s levy; note NZ has no general social security tax.)</li> </ul> Levy/Deduction Years Rate/Amount Applicability Notes ACC Earner\u2019s Levy (flat rate) 1974\u2013Present 1974: Introduced at \\~0.8% of earnings (est.) to fund new no-fault accident insurance scheme.  1990s: \\~1.0% (varied; \\~0.9\u20131.3%).  2000s: \\~1.2\u20131.7% (e.g. 2005: 1.3%; 2010: 2.0%* then 1.7%).  2015\u20132020: 1.45% then 1.39%.  2021\u20132025: Increasing from 1.39% to \\~1.83% by 2028 (approved rises). Charged on gross employment/self-employed earnings up to a yearly cap (e.g. \\$136,544 in 2022). Paid by employees via PAYE withholding, and by self-employed via ACC invoicing. Funds the ACC \u201cEarners\u2019 Account\u201d for non-work injuries. Rate set annually based on injury claim costs. Not part of income tax per se, but collected alongside it. Levy is inclusive of GST in stated rate. (Employers pay a separate ACC levy for work injuries.) Student Loan Repayment 1992\u2013Present 1992: 10% of income above threshold (\\~\\$15k). Increased to 12% from 1\u00a0Apr\u00a02013. Threshold e.g. \\$21,268 in 2025. New Zealand\u2013resident borrowers with tertiary student loans. Deducted via PAYE (or invoiced by IR for self-employed). Not a tax but functions as a mandatory deduction. NZ student loans charge 0% interest for residents (since 2006), so these deductions recoup principal. Treated separately from income tax in legislation. KiwiSaver Contributions July\u00a02007\u2013Present Default employee contribution was 4% of gross pay (2007\u20132013), then 3% from 2013 onward (employees can choose 3%, 4%, 6%, 8%, or 10%). Employers must contribute 3% minimum (plus employer\u2019s share of tax on that contribution). Employees (automatically enrolled for new hires, with opt-out option). Contributions are deducted from pay after PAYE tax. (Employers\u2019 3% is on top of salary, taxed via \u201cEmployer Superannuation Contribution Tax\u201d). KiwiSaver is a voluntary retirement savings scheme, not a tax. However, contributions are payroll-deducted similar to a levy. The government incentivizes KiwiSaver with an annual tax credit (up to \\$521 matching) for members \u2013 effectively a government subsidy, not related to income tax brackets. Superannuation Surcharge 1985\u20131998 20% then 25% tax on \u201cexcess\u201d retirement income (NZ Super pension plus other income) over a small exempt amount. E.g. in 1990s, abated 25c per \\$1 of other income beyond \\~\\$100/week, effectively taxing higher-income pensioners\u2019 NZS. Applied to recipients of NZ Superannuation (universal pension) whose total income exceeded specified thresholds. Not part of PAYE, but an additional income tax on the elderly with substantial other income. Very unpopular; abolished in 1998. (Since then, NZ Super is paid without income test, and superannuitants are taxed under normal brackets only.) Social Security (Employment) Levy 1970 (historical) 1970 only: a temporary 3\u2153% surcharge on all personal income tax rates (Dec\u00a01970\u2013Jul\u00a01971) to counter budget shortfall. (Effectively a one-time levy.) All individual taxpayers (resident and non-resident) during the period. Collected via withholding and assessment as part of income tax. Enacted by Muldoon in 1970 Mini-Budget \u2013 sometimes described as a \u201csurcharge\u201d on tax rather than a separate levy. Allowed government to raise additional revenue across the board for part of the year. Not repeated thereafter; future governments preferred explicit rate changes or base broadening. <p>[]* In 2010, ACC levy briefly spiked (to \\$2.00 per \\$100 earnings for part of the year) before dropping \u2013 reflecting ACC funding needs.</p>"},{"location":"policy_changes/","title":"New Zealand Microsimulation Model: Policy Changes Log","text":"<p>This document outlines the key changes in New Zealand's tax and transfer policies relevant to the microsimulation model, serving as a \"changelog\" for the business rules.

Such a model can simulate how policy changes (e.g. tax rate adjustments or welfare reforms) would affect each person in a representative sample, and then aggregate the results to assess impacts on government budgets and on household incomes. New Zealand\u2019s Treasury uses a microsimulation model called TAWA (Tax and Welfare Analysis) for this purpose, and similar open-source frameworks exist (e.g. OpenFisca and PolicyEngine). These models are static (non-behavioral), meaning they hold population characteristics and behaviors fixed while applying policy rules for a given year. The outputs are highly relevant for child poverty analysis and budget impact assessment: policymakers and researchers can estimate how policy tweaks might lift children out of poverty or change government spending and revenue. This report outlines the comprehensive set of inputs, policy calculations, and outputs relevant to a New Zealand tax\u2013benefit microsimulation, drawing on existing tools and best practices. Tables, figures, and appendices are provided to summarize key information.</p>"},{"location":"taxmicrosim_io/#input-data-and-key-variables","title":"Input Data and Key Variables","text":"<p>A robust microsimulation requires rich micro-level input data covering all individuals (the entire population in private households) and all factors that affect their tax liabilities or benefit entitlements. In New Zealand, the Household Economic Survey (HES) is commonly used as a base dataset, often augmented with administrative records for accuracy. The project also includes the <code>syspop</code> tool for generating realistic synthetic populations. The target population is usually residents in private dwellings (excluding institutions like prisons or rest homes) so that household and family income can be measured. Key input variables for each person or household include:</p> <ul> <li>Demographics and Family Structure: Age, sex, and other personal characteristics (ethnicity, disability status, etc.), as well as identifiers for family and household membership. Family/household structure is crucial since tax and welfare programs often depend on whether a person has a partner or dependent children. For example, a dependent child is defined (for benefit and tax credit purposes) as an unmarried person under 18 (or under 19 in school) who isn\u2019t financially independent. These definitions inform eligibility for family tax credits and certain benefits.</li> <li>Income Sources: All forms of taxable income at the individual (and sometimes family) level. This includes wages and salaries from employment, self-employment or business income, and investment income (interest, dividends, rental income). Detailed income information is needed because different income types may be taxed differently or affect benefit entitlements. In practice, administrative tax data can be linked to the survey to get accurate incomes for each person. Non-taxable income (e.g. some scholarships or allowances) may also be recorded if relevant to means-tests.</li> <li>Government Transfers Received: Indicators for whether the individual (or their family) is currently receiving any social benefits or tax credits. For example, flags for receiving a main welfare benefit like Jobseeker Support (unemployment benefit), Sole Parent Support, Supported Living Payment (disability benefit), or the universal NZ Superannuation pension. Similarly, flags for receipt of Working for Families tax credits or other support programs can be included. These flags help initialize the model and calibrate it: the model can use them to ensure the correct baseline take-up of programs, and to validate that simulated entitlements match actual receipt under current policy. They also allow identifying the subset of the population affected by changes to each program.</li> <li>Housing Costs: Housing expenditures (rent, mortgage payments, rates) are important for calculating after-housing-cost income measures and determining eligibility for housing subsidies. The input data should capture each household\u2019s housing costs. For example, the Accommodation Supplement (a means-tested housing subsidy) depends on rent or mortgage payments and region. Including housing costs enables the model to compute after-housing-cost poverty rates and to simulate housing benefits.</li> <li>Other Characteristics: Additional variables can improve the model\u2019s accuracy. These might include labor force status (employed/unemployed), hours of work or earnings period (to identify full-time vs part-time, if needed for certain credits), student status (since students may qualify for allowances), and disability indicators (affecting eligibility for certain supports). Geographic location can matter if policies have regional components (e.g. different Accommodation Supplement maxima by region). If analyzing retirement policies, an indicator of age 65+ is obviously crucial (for NZ Super). In some models, wealth or expenditure data may be included to extend analysis (e.g. to assess GST or wealth tax impacts), though these are not standard inputs for basic tax-benefit simulation.</li> </ul> <p>Table 1 below summarizes key input variables for a NZ tax\u2013welfare microsimulation model, with their typical sources:</p> Input Variable Description Source Data Individual demographics Age, sex, ethnicity, disability status, etc. HES survey (personal questionnaire) Household &amp; family IDs Identifiers linking individuals into households and nuclear families. Used to apply family-based rules (e.g. joint income tests, child benefits). HES survey (household roster) Dependent child flag Indicates if person is a dependent child (under age threshold and not financially independent). Used for child-related benefits/tax credits. Derived from age, relationship, income Earnings (wage/salary) Employment income, by pay period (weekly/annual). Admin data (IRD PAYE records via IDI) Self-employment income Business or farm income (taxable profit). Admin data (IRD tax returns) Investment income Interest, dividends, rental income (annual). Admin data (IRD tax returns) Benefit receipt indicators Flags for receiving core welfare benefits (e.g. JSS, SPS, SLP) and other transfers (e.g. NZ Super) during the year. Used to validate and simulate take-up. Admin data (MSD payment records) Housing costs Weekly rent, mortgage, and local rates paid by the household. Used for housing subsidies and poverty after housing costs. HES survey (expenditure module) Survey weights Weight for each sample household/person, to scale up to population totals. Adjusted so base-year simulation matches known aggregates (population by age, total benefit recipients, etc.). HES (calibrated, possibly adjusted via re-weighting) <p>Data preparation: The base microdata is often calibrated and projected to the desired analysis year. Calibration means adjusting sample weights so that the weighted totals align with external benchmarks (e.g. known population counts, labor force totals, or benefit recipient numbers). Projection involves updating incomes and other variables for inflation and expected growth. For instance, wages might be inflated using an earnings index, prices by CPI, rents by a housing price index, etc., to represent a future year\u2019s conditions. In New Zealand\u2019s TAWA model, a set of inflators (for earnings, CPI, interest rates, rents, etc.) are applied to bring the survey data from its original year to the policy year of interest. This allows the model to be run for any year\u2019s policy settings (past or future) without needing new survey data each time. Crucially, no behavioral changes are assumed in a static model: individuals\u2019 employment status and other behaviors remain as observed, only their incomes are scaled for growth. The demographic composition also stays constant aside from weight adjustments \u2013 the model does not simulate people aging or migrating over time (except via reweighting if desired).</p>"},{"location":"taxmicrosim_io/#policy-calculations-and-simulated-components","title":"Policy Calculations and Simulated Components","text":"<p>Once the input dataset is prepared for a given year, the microsimulation applies all relevant tax and transfer policy rules to each individual (or family). The model includes dedicated parameter files for years 2005-2025, and can fall back on historical data for years from 1890 to 2028. In this stage, the model essentially \u201crecalculates\u201d everyone\u2019s tax bills and benefit entitlements under the specified policy settings. For a comprehensive New Zealand model, everything that affects individuals\u2019 disposable income should be included. The main policy components and calculations are outlined below:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Income Tax Calculation: For each individual with taxable income, the model computes personal income tax owed using the progressive tax rates in effect for the year. New Zealand has a multi-bracket tax schedule (e.g. 10.5%, 17.5%, 30%, 33%, and 39% at various income thresholds in recent years). The model applies these rates to the person\u2019s annual taxable income to get gross tax liability. It also applies any tax credits or offsets that reduce tax:</p> </li> <li> <p>Tax Credits: An example is the Independent Earner Tax Credit (IETC), which historically provided up to NZ\\$520 per year for middle-income earners with no other support. If the simulation year includes IETC (it existed until 2018), the model checks eligibility (income range, not receiving benefits) and subtracts the credit from tax owed. Similarly, tax credits for charitable donations or payroll giving could be incorporated if data on donations were available (often not in survey data, so this may be omitted or treated as an aggregate adjustment).</p> </li> <li>ACC Levy: Uniquely, New Zealand imposes an Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC) levy on earnings to fund accident insurance. This is effectively a flat percentage charge on employment income up to a certain cap. The model includes the ACC earner\u2019s levy as an additional \u201ctax\u201d on wages/salary and self-employed income, since it directly reduces take-home pay.</li> <li> <p>Other levies or rebates: In some years there might be specific levies (for example, an earthquake levy or similar) or tax rebates for certain expenditures, but these are rare. The key point is the model should replicate the full income tax code as it applies to individuals.</p> </li> <li> <p>Social Security Contributions: Unlike many countries, NZ does not have separate social security taxes for pensions or unemployment \u2013 those are funded from general taxation. Thus, apart from the ACC levy and income tax, there are no payroll taxes on individuals to simulate. (KiwiSaver retirement savings are voluntary and not a tax, so those are outside the scope unless one specifically models their effect on take-home pay.)</p> </li> <li> <p>Family Tax Credits (Working for Families): New Zealand\u2019s system of refundable tax credits for families with children, known as Working for Families (WfF), is a crucial part of the personal tax/benefit system. The model must determine each family\u2019s eligibility for WfF tax credits and calculate the amounts. As of recent policy, there are four main components:</p> </li> <li> <p>Family Tax Credit (FTC): the primary child benefit paid to eligible families based on the number and age of children. It is phased out (abated) above a certain family income threshold. The model needs to sum each family\u2019s total family income (often net of any exempt amounts) and apply the taper rate to calculate how much FTC they receive.</p> </li> <li>In-Work Tax Credit (IWTC): an extra payment for families that have some minimum earnings from work and are not receiving a main welfare benefit. The model checks if the adults in the family meet the work criteria (e.g. a certain number of hours of work per week in older rules, though recently the hours test was removed) and are off benefit; if eligible, a fixed amount per week is added.</li> <li>Best Start Tax Credit: a payment for families with a child under a certain age (currently under 3 years old). This is a universal payment in the child\u2019s first year (i.e. not income-tested for babies) and income-tested for the second and third year. The model identifies children in the age range and applies the income abatement if applicable.</li> <li>Minimum Family Tax Credit (MFTC): this guarantees a minimum after-tax income for working families who work a certain number of hours. In practice, it tops up income to a prescribed level. The model will calculate a family\u2019s net income and, if they qualify (meeting work hours and income below the threshold), assign a top-up so that their annual after-tax income reaches the minimum. This effectively creates an implicit 100% marginal tax rate beyond the threshold (any extra dollar earned reduces the credit).</li> </ul> <p>All these credits depend on family income and number of children, so the model must aggregate incomes of spouses/partners and consider the presence of dependent children. The abatement schedule (the rate at which credits reduce as income rises) needs to be correctly applied \u2013 this is often handled by utility functions in the code that apply taper formulas. In a simulation, one can alter parameters like the credit amounts, income thresholds, or abatement rates to model policy reforms (e.g. increasing the Family Tax Credit or changing the income threshold). These are straightforward parameter changes handled by the model\u2019s rules engine.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Main Welfare Benefits: The model also simulates welfare benefit entitlements for those not in full-time work, which in New Zealand\u2019s means-tested, flat-rate benefit system include:</p> </li> <li> <p>Jobseeker Support (JSS): the unemployment or low-income benefit for working-age adults. The model determines eligibility primarily by income and assets (though assets tests and other conditions may not be fully captured in survey data). Typically, JSS has different rates for singles vs couples, and abates as earnings increase beyond a certain disregard. The microsimulation will calculate each person\u2019s theoretical JSS entitlement based on their income and family situation, and whether they meet non-income criteria (e.g. not working full-time, available for work). If using administrative flags, the model can identify who was receiving JSS and ensure consistency.</p> </li> <li>Sole Parent Support (SPS): a benefit for single parents with young children. The model checks for single adults with dependent children, and if income is below thresholds, assigns the base rate for SPS. Income from employment will reduce SPS according to its abatement regime.</li> <li>Supported Living Payment (SLP): a benefit for individuals with severe health conditions or disabilities (or carers of such individuals). Eligibility for SLP may not be fully inferable from survey data (since it depends on health status and incapacity for work), but the model can use the disability status variable as a proxy. SLP has higher payment rates and different income disregards.</li> <li>Youth Payment/Young Parent Payment: smaller programs for teens/young adults (16\u201319) in hardship. These are niche and often not explicitly modeled if data on that age group\u2019s eligibility is sparse. TAWA, for instance, does not model these \u201cnon-standard\u201d payments and instead reads actual receipt from data for baseline alignment.</li> <li>Supplementary Benefits: Many recipients of main benefits also get supplements. The model should simulate Accommodation Supplement (AS) for low-income individuals (whether on a benefit or low wages) who pay rent or a mortgage. AS entitlement depends on housing cost, location (there are geographic maximums), family size, and income after other benefits. Simulating AS requires using the housing cost inputs and applying the formula (which typically pays 70% of housing costs above a small threshold, up to a cap). Another common supplement is the Disability Allowance, which pays for additional costs for those with health/disability needs; this is hard to simulate because it depends on actual expenses (e.g. medical bills) \u2013 often such supplementary grants are not included in a static model due to data limitations.</li> <li>Winter Energy Payment (WEP): a universal top-up paid during winter months to beneficiaries and superannuitants to help with heating costs. The model can include WEP by adding the appropriate amount for those who meet the criteria (essentially anyone on a main benefit or NZ Super in winter gets it). This is a straightforward rule triggered by benefit receipt status and time of year.</li> <li> <p>The abatement of benefits as income rises is a critical calculation. Each benefit has an income test (for example, JSS might allow a small amount of weekly earnings before reducing payments at a certain cents-in-the-dollar rate). The model uses utility functions to apply these abatement schedules and compute the reduced entitlement based on any earned income. If a person\u2019s earnings are high enough, their benefit entitlement goes to zero (they \u201cexit\u201d benefit); the model should reflect that by not paying the benefit if income exceeds cutoff. In the base dataset, if someone is recorded as a recipient, typically their income was low enough; but under a policy change scenario, the model might newly enroll or disenroll individuals depending on changes in rules (e.g. if the income threshold for a benefit is raised, some additional people might qualify in the simulation).</p> </li> <li> <p>Universal Benefits: The prime example is NZ Superannuation, the public pension paid to all residents over 65. NZ Super is not means-tested (apart from some deductions if the person has certain overseas pensions). The model simply needs to assign the correct NZ Super amount to everyone above the eligibility age. Since it\u2019s universal, changes to NZ Super (like a rate increase or changing eligibility age) are simulated by toggling those parameters. Another near-universal program for children was the Best Start credit (first year of a child\u2019s life, as mentioned above) \u2013 universal in year one, income-tested after that.</p> </li> <li> <p>Other Tax/Transfer Items: A truly \u201ceverything\u201d model might also incorporate:</p> </li> <li> <p>Paid Parental Leave (PPL): a government payment for new parents who were working, for up to 26 weeks. PPL could be included by identifying eligible new parents and simulating the payment. However, since it\u2019s time-limited and the HES survey may not capture recent newborns well (sample size issues), PPL is often not explicitly modeled or is left as an exogenous scenario (it primarily affects short-term income, not annual income much if averaged).</p> </li> <li>Child Support Payments: If analyzing child poverty, one might consider child support received from non-custodial parents. In NZ, child support is administered by IRD. Historically, if the custodial parent was on benefit, the government retained the child support (it did not increase the household income). A recent reform considered \u201cpassing on\u201d child support to beneficiary families. A microsimulation can estimate the impact of such a reform if data on child support amounts is available. This is advanced usage and comes with uncertainty since not all necessary data (like liable parent income) may be in the base dataset.</li> <li>Indirect Taxes: Although not part of direct cash income, GST (Goods and Services Tax) and other indirect taxes affect households\u2019 cost of living. A static microsimulation can be extended to estimate indirect tax burdens by using expenditure data. For instance, one Treasury study combined household expenditure patterns with the model\u2019s income data to compute how much GST each household pays, in order to analyze fiscal incidence (the distribution of total tax burden, direct + indirect). Generally, core microsimulation models exclude indirect taxes by default (focusing on direct taxes/transfers), but it\u2019s a valuable extension for comprehensive analysis.</li> <li>In-kind benefits and public services: These are outside the scope of cash microsimulation, but results can be enriched by attaching a value for services like education and health per household (as was done in the fiscal incidence study). However, the model itself usually does not simulate these; they are added analytically on top of disposable income to get a \u201cfinal income\u201d concept.</li> </ul> <p>Policy parameters and code: The microsimulation model is built to be flexible: most numeric parameters (tax rates, thresholds, benefit amounts, etc.) are stored in a database or code configuration so that they can be easily changed for different years or reform scenarios. For example, to simulate a policy reform, one might input a new tax rate or a higher benefit level as a parameter change. The model will then apply the new rules and compare outcomes to the baseline. Structural changes (like introducing a completely new benefit or a new tax) may require writing new code functions (e.g. if a universal basic income were added, a new transfer function would be coded).</p> <p>Behind the scenes, the model organizes the calculations in a logical sequence. In TAWA\u2019s implementation, there are categories of functions: income calculations (to sum up or categorize income components needed for tests), transfer eligibility calculations, and tax calculations, plus helper functions for things like applying abatement formulas. The code automatically determines an order of execution (for instance, one must calculate a family\u2019s total income before applying the means-test for a family tax credit). This ensures all interdependencies (like one benefit affecting income for another) are respected.</p> <p>Limitations: Despite aiming to include \u201ceverything,\u201d some policies are difficult to model due to data constraints. TAWA, for instance, does not currently simulate Temporary Additional Support (TAS) \u2013 a discretionary top-up for people in hardship \u2013 or Childcare Assistance subsidies (which help with childcare fees). These require detailed expense information and short-term circumstances not captured well in surveys. Such omissions mean the model will not directly show the impact of changes in those programs (though analysts might adjust for them separately). Additionally, any behavioral responses (like people working more when a tax rate is cut, or take-up rates changing if a benefit becomes more generous) are not captured in a static model. If needed, those must be analyzed with separate behavioral or dynamic models, or by scenario assumptions.</p>"},{"location":"taxmicrosim_io/#outputs-and-analysis-capabilities","title":"Outputs and Analysis Capabilities","text":"<p>After applying the tax and welfare calculations for each individual/household, the microsimulation model produces a wealth of output data. This individual-level output can then be aggregated and analyzed to answer policy questions. For a comprehensive New Zealand tax-benefit model, the following outputs are particularly useful:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Fiscal Impact Metrics: These refer to the government budget implications of policies. The model can compute the total income tax revenue collected under current vs. proposed policies, as well as the total cost of each benefit or tax credit program. By comparing a reform scenario to a baseline, we obtain the net fiscal cost (or saving) of the reform. For example, if income tax thresholds are lowered, the model might show a decrease in revenue of X million dollars; if benefit levels are increased, an increase in expenditure of Y million. Typically, results would be broken down by category \u2013 e.g. \u201cIncome tax revenue changes by bracket\u201d, \u201cSpending on Jobseeker Support increases by \\$Z million\u201d, etc. A standard summary is the fiscal cost of each reform component relative to current law. This is vital for government budget planning, ensuring that any policy package meets fiscal targets. The microsimulation\u2019s fiscal estimates can also be fed into macroeconomic models or long-term fiscal projections to see system-wide effects.</p> </li> <li> <p>Distributional Impact: A core strength of microsimulation is showing who gains or loses from a policy change across the income distribution. Outputs often include distributional tables or charts that illustrate how different income groups are affected. A common approach is to divide the population into deciles or quintiles by some income measure (usually household disposable income, equivalised for household size), and then compute the average change in disposable income for each group. The model can identify \u201cwinners\u201d and \u201closers\u201d \u2013 for example, how many households in each decile have an increase in net income vs. a decrease, and the average dollar change. In TAWA\u2019s standard outputs, a winners/losers analysis is produced showing the distribution of gains and losses by income band. For households, Treasury uses HEDI (household equivalised disposable income) as the ranking variable. This accounts for taxes and transfers and adjusts for household size, enabling apples-to-apples comparison of income levels between, say, a single person and a family of five. Using HEDI, the model might report something like \u201cUnder Policy X, 60% of households in the lowest decile gain an average of \\$20 per week, while 10% lose an average of \\$5, etc.\u201d. For family-based analyses, one might group by family taxable income instead (for instance, to see outcomes by working family income brackets).</p> </li> <li> <p>Poverty and Inequality Measures: Policymakers are often keenly interested in how tax/benefit changes affect poverty rates, especially for children. The microsimulation can calculate standard poverty indicators on both baseline and reform scenarios. In New Zealand, official child poverty measures are defined in the Child Poverty Reduction Act and include thresholds like \u201cbelow 50% of median income\u201d. The model outputs can report, for example, the percentage of children (and adults) in households under 50% of median income before housing costs (BHC) and after housing costs (AHC). Specifically, Treasury focuses on the fixed-line AHC-50 measure (50% of 2018 median, after housing costs) and the moving-line BHC-50 measure (50% of contemporary median, before housing costs) when evaluating policies. Using housing cost data, the model computes AHC incomes and can determine how many children are below the threshold in each scenario. A reform like a benefit increase would typically reduce the child poverty rate, and the model can quantify by how many percentage points. Outputs can also include other poverty depth or severity metrics if needed (e.g. poverty gap, or the AHC-40 \u201csevere poverty\u201d rate), although the primary focus is usually on the headline rates. In addition to poverty, inequality indices such as the Gini coefficient or income share ratios can be calculated from the simulation\u2019s income distribution. For example, one could report the Gini of disposable income before and after a tax reform to see if inequality narrows or widens. These are not always in standard output templates but are easily derived from the micro-data results.</p> </li> <li> <p>Work Incentive Indicators: Although a static model holds behavior fixed, it can still provide insight into financial incentives by calculating effective tax rates. For instance, the model can compute each working individual\u2019s marginal effective tax rate (METR) \u2013 the share of a small income increase that is lost to taxes or benefit abatement. Similarly, participation tax rates (the percentage of gross income lost when moving from unemployment into work) can be derived for various household types. PolicyEngine\u2019s household analysis tool demonstrates this by showing how a reform changes marginal tax rates for a given household scenario. In a New Zealand context, a microsimulation could identify that, say, a single parent moving off a benefit into work faces a high effective marginal tax rate due to both income tax and the withdrawal of SPS and WfF credits. While these incentive measures are more granular than aggregate outputs, they are very useful for policy design (e.g. to flag if a reform creates very high METRs for certain income ranges).</p> </li> <li> <p>Custom Analyses and Subgroup Results: Because the model simulates all individuals, results can be disaggregated by various characteristics. Analysts often look at outcomes by family type (single, couple with kids, etc.), by region, by gender, by ethnicity, or other dimensions to understand equity impacts. For example, one could output the average income change for M\u0101ori versus non-M\u0101ori, or the fiscal cost breakdown by region \u2013 as long as the input data contains those identifiers. The TAWA model is used to produce child poverty projections by simulating future years; it can break down which types of families those children in poverty belong to (e.g. large families, single-parent families, etc.), providing insight into where policy might target. Another example of custom analysis is identifying the characteristics of children in different poverty \u201ccategories\u201d (combinations of income poverty and material hardship) to inform policy. The flexible nature of microsimulation outputs means that beyond the standard tables, users can query the micro-data for almost any distributional question (subject to sample size limits). All outputs derived from the model are typically weighted to population level and may be subject to statistical reliability checks or confidentiality rules (Treasury, for instance, applies cell suppression or rounding to protect individuals in published results).</p> </li> </ul> <p>Reporting formats: Results can be presented in tables, charts, and interactive dashboards. For instance, a PolicyEngine interface might show a budget impact bar chart and a poverty rate change summary side by side. A typical report will include a table of fiscal impacts, a graph of the distribution of gains (often a \u201cwinners and losers\u201d bar chart by income decile), and a table showing key poverty metrics before and after the reform. In our appendices, we provide examples of how such outputs might be structured for clarity.</p> <p>Finally, validation of outputs is crucial. The model\u2019s baseline outputs should be cross-checked against external data \u2013 e.g. the total income tax from the simulation vs. actual IRD collections, the number of beneficiaries simulated vs. administrative counts, poverty rates vs. Stats NZ official figures. Any gaps inform improvements (for example, if poverty is off because not all material hardship is captured, one knows to interpret accordingly). TAWA\u2019s development has involved benchmarking its results to ensure credibility. Assuming the model is well-calibrated, it becomes a reliable laboratory to test \u201cwhat if\u201d scenarios, which is exactly its value to policymakers and researchers interested in both fiscal and social outcomes.</p>"},{"location":"taxmicrosim_io/#comparison-with-existing-tools-and-models","title":"Comparison with Existing Tools and Models","text":"<p>It\u2019s helpful to compare the structure we\u2019ve outlined with other tax-benefit microsimulation tools:</p> <ul> <li>Treasury\u2019s TAWA Model: As described, TAWA is the official NZ Government microsimulation for personal taxes and transfers. It uses HES data linked to administrative records and produces analysis for budget measures and child poverty tracking. The inputs, calculations, and outputs we have detailed align closely with TAWA\u2019s design. TAWA\u2019s methodology report confirms the inclusion of all major benefits, tax credits, and taxes in New Zealand\u2019s system. It\u2019s used internally for policy advice and to project the future trajectory of poverty under current settings.</li> <li>OpenFisca: OpenFisca is an open-source engine that allows coding a country\u2019s legislation (\u201crules as code\u201d). An OpenFisca model for Aotearoa New Zealand has been prototyped, encoding things like the Income Tax Act and Social Security Act parameters. In essence, an OpenFisca-based NZ model would require the same inputs (micro-data on individuals) and could compute the same outputs, but it\u2019s more geared towards providing an API or calculator. For example, it can enable a web tool where a user inputs their household situation and the engine returns their entitlements and tax under various scenarios \u2013 effectively turning law into software. While OpenFisca in NZ is not yet as comprehensive as TAWA, it demonstrates the feasibility of an open, collaborative microsimulation model.</li> <li>PolicyEngine: PolicyEngine (for the UK and US) is a user-facing application built on microsimulation principles. It lets users tweak policy parameters through a GUI and then see results like the budget effect, poverty change, inequality change, and even impacts on a custom household. A NZ PolicyEngine would present similar outputs. From the UK example, we saw that the tool explicitly provides \u201cthe effect on the budget, poverty impacts, distributional impacts and more\u201d for a reform. It also allows drilling down to example households to see detailed net income calculations and marginal tax rate charts. This underscores that the outputs we enumerated (fiscal, poverty, distribution, etc.) are not unique to TAWA but are standard in modern microsimulation analysis. PolicyEngine\u2019s development team even forked the OpenFisca engine to better support such rich output and interactivity. For our purposes, the lesson is that any comprehensive NZ model should be able to produce at least the same set of indicators \u2013 and perhaps be extended with a user-friendly interface for broader use.</li> <li>OECD Tax-Benefit Model (TaxBEN): This is a comparative static microsimulation that the OECD uses to analyze work incentives across countries. It differs in that it uses hypothetical families (\u201cvignettes\u201d) rather than the actual population. However, it covers the main policy rules for each country. According to OECD, TaxBEN includes \u201cthe main taxes on employment income, social contributions, and the main cash benefit programs (unemployment benefits, family and childcare benefits, guaranteed minimum-income benefits, housing benefits, and in-work benefits)\u201d. It deliberately excludes things like indirect taxes (GST/VAT), wealth taxes, and in-kind benefits. Our described model similarly focuses on cash transfers and direct taxes affecting disposable income, aligning with TaxBEN\u2019s scope. The difference is that we run on a full micro-data distribution, which enables the distributional output (TaxBEN instead typically outputs effective tax rates for example families at various earnings levels). TaxBEN\u2019s documentation can be a useful resource to double-check policy details and ensure no major program is omitted.</li> </ul> <p>In summary, the inputs, calculations, and outputs we have outlined for a New Zealand static microsimulation model are well-aligned with both domestic practice (Treasury\u2019s TAWA) and international tools. All individuals in the population are represented, all taxes and benefits that affect household incomes are simulated (with noted exceptions where data is lacking), and the analytical outputs range from government fiscal costs to detailed poverty and distributional analyses. By capturing \u201ceverything\u201d in one integrated model, one can answer a wide array of policy questions \u2013 from \u201cHow much will this tax cut cost and who benefits most?\u201d to \u201cHow many children will be lifted out of poverty if we increase family support payments?\u201d \u2013 using a consistent evidence base.</p>"},{"location":"taxmicrosim_io/#conclusion","title":"Conclusion","text":"<p>Developing a comprehensive microsimulation of New Zealand\u2019s personal tax and welfare system involves gathering extensive microdata inputs, faithfully encoding the myriad policy rules, and generating outputs that illuminate both fiscal and social outcomes.

It becomes possible to examine policy trade-offs in detail: for instance, evaluating a child poverty reduction package by seeing the direct effect on poverty statistics, the cost to the budget, and the distribution of gains across society. Both government analysts and outside researchers (such as those focused on child wellbeing) can use the model to test policy ideas in a virtual environment before implementing them in the real world.</p> <p>Looking ahead, maintaining the model\u2019s accuracy will require regular updates to reflect policy changes (tax rate adjustments, benefit increases, etc.) and improvements in data (for example, better capturing under-represented groups or linking new data sources for things like material hardship).

Such a table helps budget analysts see if a package of changes is self-funding or requires additional financing.</p> <p>Figure A1. Distributional Impact by Household Income Decile \u2013 A bar chart could illustrate the average change in annual disposable income per household, for each income decile, under a policy reform. Positive values indicate a gain (tax cut or benefit increase), negative a loss. Each bar might be annotated with the percentage of households in that decile that are net winners. For example, deciles 1\u20133 (low income) might show a significant average gain due to a benefit increase, middle deciles little change, and the top decile a slight loss if a new tax on high incomes is introduced. This visual immediately shows who benefits most. (In an interactive setting like PolicyEngine, one can hover on each decile to see detailed stats.)</p> <p>Table A2. Poverty Outcomes Before vs. After Reform \u2013 This table would show key poverty rates and counts under the status quo and the reform scenario:</p> Poverty Measure (Children) Baseline Rate Reform Rate Change (points) Baseline # of Children Change in # BHC 50% (relative, before housing) 15.0% 13.0% \u20132.0 ppt 170,000 \u201323,000 AHC 50% (fixed-line 2018, after housing) 18.0% 15.5% \u20132.5 ppt 204,000 \u201328,000 Material hardship (deprivation index \u22646) 11.3% 10.0% \u20131.3 ppt 128,000 \u201315,000 <p>(ppt = percentage points. Child population \\~950,000 for context.)</p> <p>This shows, for instance, that the reform (perhaps a package increasing family incomes) is projected to reduce the after-housing-cost 50% poverty rate for children from 18.0% to 15.5%, lifting about 28,000 children above that threshold. Such tables often accompany government reporting on child poverty targets. The inclusion of material hardship (if available) gives another lens on wellbeing beyond income poverty, though hardship measures may not change in lockstep with income changes.</p> <p>Figure A2. Winners and Losers Distribution \u2013 A chart can also display the share of households that gain or lose by certain amounts. For example, a histogram: X% of households have an income change between +\\$10 and +\\$20 per week, Y% gain more than \\$50, Z% lose between \\$5 and \\$10, etc. This kind of chart highlights that, say, \u201cmost families with children gain modestly, while a small fraction of high earners pay more tax\u201d. It complements the decile average view by showing the spread of impacts within each decile or population.</p> <p>In all output tables/figures, notes and definitions should clarify the income concept (equivalised or not, weekly vs annual), the population scope (all individuals, or just certain households), and any important assumptions (e.g. full take-up of benefits is assumed, behavioral changes not included, etc.). All these ensure the results are interpreted correctly by policymakers and other stakeholders.</p> <p>Overall, the microsimulation\u2019s rich set of outputs allows for transparent and detailed evaluation of policy proposals, helping to strike a balance between fiscal constraints and social objectives like reducing poverty.

microsimulation model is used in both calibrating the model results to actual entitlements for the tax year as well as projecting costs for future tax years for common parameter changes. The microsimulation model can be used in the following ways: * Impact of changes to entitlements e.g. increase FTC, IWTC, BSTC or MFTC guaranteed income amount * Changes to abatement rates and thresholds for FTC/IWTC and BSTC * Introducing a second abatement tier for FTC and IWTC * Measuring the impact on WFF payments from changes in income Program name: s 18(c)(i) sas The 2023 represents the tax year the data is built from. The model is structured as a macro, thereby making it easier to run multiple simulations with different changes in the input parameters. The macro input variables are structured as famsim(ftc1,ftc2,iwtc1,iwtc2,bstc,mftc,abatethresh1,abatethresh2,abaterate1,abaterate2,bstcthresh, bstcabate,wagegwt) With the input variables comprising: * ftc1 = Unabated FTC entitlement for eldest child * ftc2 = Unabated FTC entitlement for subsequent child * iwtc1 = IWTC entitlement for 1-3 children * iwtc2 = IWTC entitlement for 4+ children * bstc = BSTC entitlement * mftc = MFTC guaranteed income amount before tax (ie gross income) * abatethresh1 = first FTC/IWTC abatement threshold * abatethresh2 = second FTC/IWTC abatement threshold (if any) * abaterate1 = abatement rate for the first FTC/IWTC abatement threshold * abaterate2 = abatement rate for the second FTC/IWTC abatement threshold * bstcabate = abatement threshold for BSTC * bstcabater = abatement rate for BSTC * wagegwt = wage growth - growth in average ordinary weekly earnings on a March year basis The model is structured around 5 sections: 1. Projecting income in the forecast period 2. Calculating abatement 3. Calculating entitlements (before abatement) 4. Calculating the abated entitlement 5. Calibrations [IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL] 1. Projecting income in the forecast period Family scheme income is projected into the forecast period by increasing the income amount by a user defined growth rate (wagegwt), expressed as a decimal e.g. 6% would be defined at 0.06. All income types are projected using the same growth parameter. Future iterations of the model will enable different rates of growth percentages to be applied to different types of income, e.g. growing benefits at the rate of CPI rather than wage growth. Within the WFF scheme, year on year family income can grow at a faster rate than a base multiplier, and can fall. In 2022, family scheme income grew faster than the population average for all income for families with incomes under $70,000, while family scheme income for families with incomes greater than $70,000 grew at a slower rate than the base multiplier and for some families it was negative. This reflected a shortage of unskilled labour in that year following the reopening of the economy post covid. Therefore, a major limitation of the model is applying a static rate of income growth to all individuals in the WFF population. Future enhancements of the model could look at introducing income multipliers so that the growth rates could range from -3x the multiplier to +3x the multiplier as well as randomly doubling the number of families to achieve population growth 2. Calculating potential abatement The model has two abatement thresholds set for modelling abatement of FTC and IWTC and one abatement threshold set for modelling BSTC. For abatement of FTC and IWTC the model calculates the abatement as: * If family scheme income is less than the lowest abatement tier, then abatement is $0 * If family scheme income is between the 2 abatement tiers, then abatement amount is (family scheme income \u2013 first abatement tier) * abatement rate for first tier * If family scheme income is above the second abatement tier, then abatement amount is calculated as (second abatement tier \u2013 first abatement tier) * abatement rate for first tier + (family scheme income \u2013 second abatement tier) * abatement rate for second tier For abatement of BSTC for children that are more than 12 months old, the model calculates abatement as: * If family scheme income is less than the BSTC abatement tier, then abatement is $0 * If family scheme income is above the BSTC abatement tier, then abatement amount is (family scheme income \u2013 abatement tier) * abatement rate For both abatement calculations, if the maximum length of time that a child in the WFF scheme is less than 365 days, then the abatement amount is scaled down by the maximum number of kid days / 365. This reflects the system prorating the abatement into the relationship period and mirrors the methodology used in calculating entitlements using child weights in the section below. [IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL] 3. Calculating entitlements (before abatement) Child weights were calculated in Part B of the model, with separate weights developed for FTC, IWTC, BSTC (0-1 year and 1year +) and MFTC. The weights reflect the time that the child was included in the family. These weights are used to determine the entitlement for each tax credit. FTC entitlement If the FTC child weight is less than 1 (ie the child has been enrolled in the WFF program for less than 12 months) then the FTC entitlement amount is calculated as: FTCwgt * eldest child entitlement amount Where the FTC child weight is greater than 1 then the FTC entitlement amount is calculated as: Eldest child entitlement amount + subsequent child entitlement amount * (FTCwgt \u2013 1) IWTC entitlement The number of months the family is entitlement to IWTC to has been calculated in Part B. If the IWTC child weight is less than 1, then the IWTC entitlement amount is calculated as: IWTC entitlement &lt; 3 children * IWTCwgt * number of months eligible / 12 If the IWTC child weight is less than or equal to 3, then the IWTC entitlement amount is calculated as: IWTC entitlement &lt; 3 children * number of months eligible / 12 If the IWTC child weight is greater than 3, then the IWTC entitlement amount is calculated as: (IWTC entitlement &lt; 3 children + (IWTCwgt \u2013 3) * IWTC entitlement 4+ children) * number of months eligible / 12 BSTC entitlement The maximum BSTC entitlement for children aged 0-1 is calculated as: BSTC entitlement per child * (BSTC0wgt \u2013 number of fortnights receiving PPL / 26) with a minimum value of $0 The maximum entitlement for children aged 1-3 id calculated as: BSTC entitlement per child * BSTC1wgt MFTC entitlement In Part B, a MFTC entitlement was calculated for everyone on a per month basis. A value would be created if their wage and salary income (excluding payments from a company they own) before was less than the pretax monthly MFTC guaranteed income amount. [IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL] The MFTC entitlement is calculated for families with annual family scheme income less than the MFTC guaranteed income amount (before tax) and the total amount of MFTC calculated on a monthly basis is greater than 0 and if calculated MFTC eligibility is greater than 0. The amount of MFTC they are eligible for is calculated as the lessor of: * The total of the calculated MFTC monthly amount calculated in Part B summed over the year, or * The MFTC guaranteed income amount (before tax) less family scheme income * (1 \u2013 personal income tax of 17.5%) The final calculation is reduced by shared care (MFTCwgt), if any. 4. Calculated entitlement after abatement If there are no children with shared care arrangements in the family then final entitlements are calculated as: * FTC entitlement less FTC/IWTC abatement amount. If the FTC/IWTC abatement amount is greater than the FTC entitlement then the FTC entitlement is $0 and any remaining abatement amount is carried forward into the IWTC calculation * IWTC entitlement less any carry forward FTC/IWTC abatement * BSTC entitlement for 0-1 child plus (BSTC entitlement for children aged 1+ less BSTC abatement for children aged 1+, with a minimum value of $0) * MFTC entitlement is equal to the entitlement calculated directly above If there are children with shared care arrangements, then each of the entitlements calculated above under the no shared care approach is adjusted for shared care. 5. Calibrations One calibration has been introduced into the model. Where the IWTC paid for the tax year is equal to $0 and the family has at least one person self employed, it is assumed that IR has otherwise determined that the family is not entitled to IWTC. Therefore, any IWTC amount calculated for the family by the model is set to $0.</p>"},{"location":"external/","title":"External Documents","text":"<p>This directory contains external reference documents that were used in the development of the NZ Microsimulation Model.</p>"},{"location":"external/#contents","title":"Contents:","text":"<ul> <li><code>25OIA2363 Appendix A Mordaunt.pdf</code>: Appendix A from the Mordaunt OIA response, containing details of the SAS models.</li> <li><code>25OIA2363 Signed response Mordaunt.pdf</code>: The signed response document from the Mordaunt OIA.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"modules/behavioural/","title":"Dynamic Behavioural Extensions","text":"<p>The Policy Simulation Library now includes a module for simulating the dynamic behavioural responses of individuals to changes in the tax and benefit system.

Pros &amp; Cons","text":"<p>Moving to a data-driven architecture is a significant decision with major trade-offs.</p> <p>Pros:</p> <ul> <li>Flexibility: As you identified, rules could be added or changed without deploying new Python code. This is the primary advantage.</li> <li>Accessibility: With a well-defined schema and good tooling, it's possible that non-programmers (e.g., policy analysts) could read, understand, and perhaps even modify rules.</li> <li>Auditability &amp; Transparency: The complete logic of a rule is explicitly defined in a single data structure, which can be easier to audit than Python code spread across multiple files.</li> </ul> <p>Cons:</p> <ul> <li>Engine Complexity: The rules engine itself is a complex piece of software. It needs to be robust, secure, and handle all the logical cases required by the domain. This is a very significant engineering effort.</li> <li>Performance: A generic engine that interprets rules from data will almost certainly be slower than the current system of specialized, compiled Python functions. For a large-scale simulation, this could be a major issue.</li> <li>Expressiveness Limitations: It is very difficult to design a JSON schema that can elegantly handle all possible computational logic. The engine might not be able to express a particularly complex new rule, forcing a \"leaky abstraction\" where some rules remain in Python anyway.</li> <li>Debugging &amp; Tooling: Debugging becomes much harder. Instead of placing a breakpoint in a Python function, a developer has to debug the engine itself as it processes the rule data. Standard development tools (linters, static analyzers) would not understand the JSON rules.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"proposals/data_driven_rules_engine/#5-high-level-roadmap","title":"5.
